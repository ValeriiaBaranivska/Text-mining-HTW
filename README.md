### **Subtopics:**

1. analysis of successful cases and what leads to it in order to find main advantages or flaws of different law systems in states (for example) 
2. overwriting of the global court rules over the local (maybe some lands tend to be more influenced by the main court)
3. how different states/countries treat similar types of cases (e.g. labor disputes, criminal appeals, environmental law) and is it possible to predict an outcome based on state/region vs based only on case _(Valeriia and Irina)_
