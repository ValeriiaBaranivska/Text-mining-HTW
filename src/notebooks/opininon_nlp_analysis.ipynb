Background\\n\\n      A.    Factual\\n\\n      For the purposes of resolving CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, the\\n\\nCourt assumes the facts alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint\\n\\nto be true and construes them in Ms. Pool’s favor. See Baird v.\\n\\nGotbaum, 792 F.3d 166, 169 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n                                2\\n\f     In 2007, CNA arranged for Ms. Pool to provide daily nursing\\n\\nservices in South Africa to Daniel Brink (“Mr. Brink”), a\\n\\ncontractor who had sustained several injuries from an explosion\\n\\nin Iraq. See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 86–87. Ms. Pool submitted a\\n\\nseries of invoices to CNA seeking payment for her services and\\n\\nreimbursement for other services and supplies. See id. ¶ 88. CNA\\n\\ninitially paid some invoices but at some point, stopped. See id.\\n\\n¶ 89. Because she had not been reimbursed for services and\\n\\nsupplies, medical companies and service providers later brought\\n\\ncollections actions totaling over $150,000 against Ms. Pool and\\n\\nher company, Guardian Medical. See id. ¶¶ 90–91.\\n\\n     On September 26, 2011, Ms. Pool and other plaintiffs\\n\\n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this class action against\\n\\nvarious government contractors and their insurance carriers. See\\n\\nCompl., ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 453–64. Plaintiffs alleged violations of\\n\\nthe Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. §\\n\\n901 et seq.; the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\\n\\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq.; and the Americans with\\n\\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; along with\\n\\nvarious state-law claims. See generally id. The Court dismissed\\n\\nall claims, see Brink v. XE Holding, LLC, 910 F. Supp. 2d 242,\\n\\n258 (D.D.C. 2012), aff’d in part, vacated in part, remanded sub\\n\\nnom. Brink v. Cont’l Ins. Co., 787 F.3d 1120 (D.C. Cir. 2015);\\n\\nand the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\\n\\n                               3\\n\f(“D.C. Circuit”) affirmed the ruling except the dismissal of the\\n\\nADA claims, see Brink, 787 F.3d at 1126, 1128–29. The D.C.\\n\\nCircuit stated that its ruling did “not preclude separate\\n\\nproceedings for . . . Nicky Pool to allege a breach of\\n\\ncontract.” Id. at 1126. Ms. Pool thereafter filed an amended\\n\\ncomplaint alleging breach of contract and tortious breach of the\\n\\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶\\n\\n1, 153-68.\\n\\n     B.   Procedural\\n\\n     On March 5, 2018, CNA filed this Motion to Dismiss Ms.\\n\\nPool’s state-law claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint. See\\n\\nDef.’s Mot., ECF No. 220. Ms. Pool submitted her opposition\\n\\nbrief on April 8, 2018, see Pl.’s Resp. &amp; Opp’n Def. CNA’s Mot.\\n\\nDismiss Counts V &amp; VI Fourth Am. Compl.

Objections to a Magistrate Judge’s Report and\\n          Recommendation\\n\\n     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), a party\\n\\nmay file specific written objections once a magistrate judge has\\n\\nentered a recommended disposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1)-(2).\\n\\nA district court “may accept, reject, or modify the recommended\\n\\ndisposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); see also 28 U.S.C. §\\n\\n636(b)(1)(C) (“A judge of the court may accept, reject, or\\n\\nmodify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations\\n\\nmade by the magistrate judge.”). A district court “must\\n\\ndetermine de novo any part of the magistrate judge’s disposition\\n\\nthat has been properly objected to.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).\\n\\n“If, however, the party makes only conclusory or general\\n\\nobjections, or simply reiterates his original arguments, the\\n\\n\\n                               5\\n\fCourt reviews the [R. &amp; R.] only for clear error.” Houlahan v.\\n\\nBrown, 979 F. Supp. 2d 86, 88 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation and\\n\\ninternal quotation marks omitted). “Under the clearly erroneous\\n\\nstandard, the magistrate judge’s decision is entitled to great\\n\\ndeference” and “is clearly erroneous only if on the entire\\n\\nevidence the court is left with the definite and firm conviction\\n\\nthat a mistake has been committed.” Buie v. Dist. of Columbia,\\n\\nNo. CV 16-1920 (CKK), 2019 WL 4345712, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 12,\\n\\n2019) (citing Graham v. Mukasey, 608 F. Supp. 2d 50, 52 (D.D.C.\\n\\n2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n     Objections must “specifically identify the portions of the\\n\\nproposed findings and recommendations to which objection is made\\n\\nand the basis for the objection[s].” LCvR 72.3(b). “[O]bjections\\n\\nwhich merely rehash an argument presented and considered by the\\n\\nmagistrate judge are not ‘properly objected to’ and are\\n\\ntherefore not entitled to de novo review.” Shurtleff v. EPA, 991\\n\\nF. Supp. 2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Morgan v. Astrue, No.\\n\\n08-2133, 2009 WL 3541001, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 30, 2009)).\\n\\n     B.   Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for\\n\\ndismissal of an action for “lack of subject matter\\n\\njurisdiction.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On a Rule 12(b)(1)\\n\\nmotion to dismiss, the party asserting jurisdiction has the\\n\\nburden of establishing that the Court has subject matter\\n\\n                               6\\n\fjurisdiction over the case. See Logan v. Dep’t of Veterans\\n\\nAffs., 357 F. Supp. 2d 149, 153 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing McNutt v.\\n\\nGen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182–83,\\n\\n(1936)). “Because Rule 12(b)(1) concerns a court’s ability to\\n\\nhear a particular claim, the court must scrutinize the [party]’s\\n\\nallegations more closely when considering a motion to dismiss\\n\\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) than it would under a motion to\\n\\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Schmidt v. U.S. Capitol\\n\\nPolice Bd., 826 F. Supp. 2d 59, 65 (D.D.C. 2011) (citations\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     To assess whether a complaint sufficiently alleges subject\\n\\nmatter jurisdiction, the Court accepts as true the allegations\\n\\nof the complaint, see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\\n\\n(2009); and liberally construes the pleadings in the plaintiff’s\\n\\nfavor, see Barr v. Clinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n2004). The Court may also consider “undisputed facts evidenced\\n\\nin the record” as well as its own “resolution of disputed\\n\\nfacts.” Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 1992).\\n\\n     C.     Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n     A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\\n\\nProcedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint.\\n\\nBrowning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). A\\n\\ncomplaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim\\n\\n                                 7\\n\fshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give\\n\\nthe defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the\\n\\ngrounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\\n\\nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     Despite this liberal pleading standard, to survive a motion\\n\\nto dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter,\\n\\naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible\\n\\non its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citation and internal\\n\\nquotation marks omitted). “In determining whether a complaint\\n\\nfails to state a claim, [the court] may consider only the facts\\n\\nalleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or\\n\\nincorporated in the complaint and matters of which [the court]\\n\\nmay take judicial notice.” EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial\\n\\nSch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997). A claim is facially\\n\\nplausible when the facts pled in the complaint allow the court\\n\\nto “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\\n\\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The\\n\\nstandard does not amount to a “probability requirement,” but it\\n\\ndoes require more than a “sheer possibility that a defendant has\\n\\nacted unlawfully.” Id.\\n\\n     “[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss [pursuant\\n\\nto Rule 12(b)(6)], a judge must accept as true all of the\\n\\nfactual allegations contained in the complaint.” Atherton v.\\n\\n                               8\\n\fD.C. Off. of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\\n\\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition,\\n\\nthe court must give the plaintiff the “benefit of all inferences\\n\\nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.” Kowal v. MCI\\n\\nCommc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\\n\\nIV.   Analysis\\n\\n      A.   The Court Has Diversity Jurisdiction Over Ms. Pool’s\\n           Claims\\n\\n      The Fourth Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges diversity of\\n\\ncitizenship as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. See FAC,\\n\\nECF No. 214 ¶ 3. Magistrate Judge Faruqui concluded that Ms.\\n\\nPool failed to establish diversity jurisdiction because she\\n\\nprovided no facts to support her legal conclusion that “there is\\n\\ncomplete diversity of citizenship of the parties.” R. &amp;. R., ECF\\n\\nNo. 248 at 4-5. Ms. Pool did not object to Magistrate Judge\\n\\nFaruqui’s conclusion in her objections to the R. &amp;. R., see\\n\\ngenerally Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1; but did argue in her\\n\\nresponse to CNA’s objections that CNA incorrectly argued that\\n\\nthere is no diversity jurisdiction, arguing that the FAC alleges\\n\\ncomplete diversity of citizenship as to herself and CNA, Pl.’s\\n\\nOpp’n, ECF No. 253 at 15-16.\\n\\n      The Court has an “affirmative obligation to determine\\n\\nwhether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the action.”\\n\\nFriends Christian High Sch. v. Geneva Fin. Consultants, 321\\n\\n\\n                                9\\n\fF.R.D. 20, 22 (D.D.C. 2017). Diversity jurisdiction exists when\\n\\nthe action involves citizens of different states, and the amount\\n\\nin controversy exceeds $75,000.00 per plaintiff, exclusive of\\n\\ninterest and costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Each plaintiff must be\\n\\ndiverse from each defendant for diversity jurisdiction to exist.\\n\\nSee In re Lorazepam &amp; Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 631 F.3d\\n\\n537, 541 (D.C. Cir. 2011). “[T]he party seeking the exercise of\\n\\ndiversity jurisdiction bears the burden of pleading the\\n\\ncitizenship of each and every party to the action.” Naartex\\n\\nConsulting Corp. v. Watt, 722 F.2d 779, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1983). At\\n\\nthis time, the only parties that remain in this action are Ms.\\n\\nPool and CNA. Accordingly, Ms. Pool needs to allege complete\\n\\ndiversity between herself and CNA. For the reasons explained\\n\\nbelow and liberally construing the pleadings in her favor, the\\n\\nCourt concludes that Ms. Pool has adequately alleged diversity\\n\\njurisdiction.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool alleges that she is a foreign national of South\\n\\nAfrica. The FAC alleges that “[o]ne of the Plaintiffs described\\n\\nbelow is a foreign national from South Africa who was denied pay\\n\\nunder an agreement with Continental Insurance Company that\\n\\ncaused loss to her and her business as described below.” FAC,\\n\\nECF No. 214 ¶ 5. The only Plaintiff who alleges that she was\\n\\ndenied pay under an agreement with CNA is Ms. Pool. See id. ¶¶\\n\\n153-167.\\n\\n                               10\\n\f     “[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every\\n\\nState and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of\\n\\nthe State or foreign state where it has its principal place of\\n\\nbusiness.” 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1). The FAC alleges that CNA’s\\n\\nheadquarters is in Chicago, Illinois. See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶ 93.\\n\\nWith these allegations, Ms. Pool has adequately alleged complete\\n\\ndiversity between herself and CNA because she has alleged that\\n\\nshe is a citizen of South Africa and that CNA is a citizen of\\n\\nIllinois. Ms. Pool also alleges damages in excess of $200,000.\\n\\nId. ¶ 97, 156. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Ms.\\n\\nPool has adequately alleged diversity jurisdiction.\\n\\n     The FAC does not allege that the Court has supplemental\\n\\njurisdiction over Ms. Pool’s claims against CNA. Ms. Pool\\n\\nalleges claims for breach of contract, see id. ¶¶ 153-164; and\\n\\ntortious breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, see\\n\\nid. ¶¶ 165-168. However, the FAC alleges only that “[t]he court\\n\\nhas supplemental jurisdiction over the federal common law or\\n\\nstate law claims for fraud, bad faith insurance practices,\\n\\noutrage, and deception in trade practices.” Id. ¶ 3. Because the\\n\\nCourt has determined that it has diversity jurisdiction over Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims, however, the Court need not address the parties’\\n\\narguments regarding supplemental jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               11\\n\f     B.   The Court Adopts the Portion of the R. &amp; R. Regarding\\n          the Statute of Limitations\\n\\n     Both parties object to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nconclusions as to whether the statute of limitations bars Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees\\n\\nwith Magistrate Judge Faruqui that Ms. Pool’s invoices from June\\n\\n30, 2008 to October 30, 2009 fall within the statute of\\n\\nlimitations and that her invoices preceding that period are\\n\\nbarred.\\n\\n          1.   Ms. Pool’s Claims Relate Back to the Original\\n               Complaint\\n\\n     CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that\\n\\nMs. Pool’s claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint relate back to\\n\\nthe original Complaint. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-20.\\n\\n     An amended complaint “relates back to the date of the\\n\\noriginal pleading when[] . . . the amendment asserts a claim or\\n\\ndefense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\\n\\noccurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original\\n\\npleading.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). To determine whether the\\n\\namendment relates back, the court inquires “whether the original\\n\\ncomplaint adequately notified the defendant[] of the basis for\\n\\nliability the plaintiff[] would later advance in the amended\\n\\ncomplaint.” Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 533 F.3d 857, 866\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 2008).\\n\\n\\n\\n                               12\\n\f     CNA asserts that Magistrate Judge Faruqui erred for two\\n\\nreasons. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-20. First, CNA\\n\\ncontends that Magistrate Judge Faruqui failed to consider that\\n\\n“a new claim cannot relate back to claims that were eliminated\\n\\nfrom the prior complaint.” Id. at 18 (citing Halldorson v. Sandi\\n\\nGrp., 934 F. Supp. 2d 147, 158 (D.D.C. 2013); Wagner v.\\n\\nGeorgetown Univ. Med. Ctr., 768 A.2d 546, 559 (D.C. 2001)).\\n\\nSecond, CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui erroneously\\n\\nlimited his inquiry to whether CNA was on notice of Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nclaims and “did not undertake the necessary analysis of whether\\n\\n[Ms.] Pool’s new individual claim for breach of contract arises\\n\\nfrom the ‘same conduct’ that forms the basis of” the claims that\\n\\nremain in the case. Id. at 19 (citations omitted). Here, CNA\\n\\nconcludes that Ms. Pool’s claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint\\n\\ncannot relate back to the claims in the original Complaint\\n\\nbecause: the Court dismissed the Second Amended Complaint “in\\n\\nits entirety”; the only claims that remain now are the ADA\\n\\nclaims by other plaintiffs in the case; and the ADA claims do\\n\\nnot pertain to Mr. Brink, Ms. Pool, or CNA. Id.\\n\\n     As to CNA’s first point, Ms. Pool argues that CNA has\\n\\nmisinterpreted the caselaw and that the caselaw limits relation\\n\\nback only when the older claim was voluntarily dismissed. See\\n\\nPl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 14 (citing Halldorson, 934 F.2 at\\n\\n158). The Court agrees with Ms. Pool that the caselaw does not\\n\\n                               13\\n\fsupport CNA’s position. In Halldorson, the Court held that the\\n\\nstate-law retaliation claims in the third amended complaint did\\n\\nnot relate back to previous allegations because the second\\n\\namended complaint “eliminated” the state-law retaliation claims\\n\\nand the settlement agreement preceding the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint otherwise barred common-law theories of recovery.\\n\\nHalldorson, 934 F.2 at 158. Here, by contrast, previous\\n\\nlitigation “eliminated” only the class claims alleged by Ms.\\n\\nPool and other plaintiffs against CNA and other defendants but\\n\\n“d[id] not preclude separate proceedings for . . . [Ms.] Pool to\\n\\nallege [an individual claim for] breach of contract” against\\n\\nCNA. Brink, 787 F.3d at 1126. Halldorson is therefore\\n\\ndistinguishable from the instant case.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool does not address CNA’s second point that\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui failed to consider whether her new\\n\\nclaim arose from the same conduct as the original claim. See\\n\\nPl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 12-14. She instead defends\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that CNA had notice of Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims, see id.; an issue that CNA does not dispute in\\n\\nits Objections, see generally Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-\\n\\n20. Despite her silence, the Court is persuaded that Magistrate\\n\\nJudge Faruqui undertook the necessary Rule 15 analysis here.\\n\\n“[B]oth elements [of Rule 15]—same conduct and adequate notice—\\n\\nmust be satisfied before relation back of new claims is\\n\\n                               14\\n\fpermitted.” Constr. Interior Sys., Inc., 813 F. Supp. at 37. The\\n\\ndistrict court there held that the new claim did not relate back\\n\\nto the original pleadings in part because the “factual\\n\\nunderpinnings” of the new claim were “entirely different” from\\n\\nthose in the original complaint. Id. at 36-37. Here, as\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui explained in the R. &amp; R., see R. &amp; R.,\\n\\nECF No. 248 at 6; the factual underpinnings of Ms. Pool’s new\\n\\nclaims are the same as those of her previous class claim,\\n\\ncompare FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 86-97, with Compl., ECF No. 1 ¶¶\\n\\n453-64. Stated differently, the new individual claim arose from\\n\\nthe same conduct as the original pleading. See United States v.\\n\\nHicks, 283 F.3d 380, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\\n\\n     Finally, CNA argues that Ms. Pool’s claims do not relate\\n\\nback because the D.C. Circuit “did not remand the case with\\n\\ndirections to allow amending the complaint to include Pool’s\\n\\nindividual claims.” Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 20. This\\n\\nargument ignores, however, that the D.C. Circuit did not\\n\\nprohibit Ms. Pool from seeking leave to amend the complaint to\\n\\nallege individual claims. Cf. Brink, 787 F.3d at 1126\\n\\n(explaining that the decision “does not preclude separate\\n\\nproceedings for . . . [Ms.] Pool to allege a breach of\\n\\ncontract”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) (“The court should freely\\n\\ngive leave [to amend the complaint] when justice so requires.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n                               15\\n\f      Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool’s individual\\n\\nclaims relate back to the original Complaint and ADOPTS that\\n\\nportion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n           2.   Magistrate Judge Faruqui Correctly Assumed an\\n                Installment Contract with a Three-month Payment\\n                Term\\n\\n      Both parties object to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s analysis\\n\\nand conclusion as to when Ms. Pool’s claims accrued. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12; Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 20-\\n\\n21.\\n\\n      CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui incorrectly\\n\\nassumed the existence of an installment contract. Def.’s Objs.,\\n\\nECF No. 252 at 20. CNA asserts that this assumption is erroneous\\n\\nbecause it is based on information in Ms. Pool’s Opposition to\\n\\nCNA’s Motion to Dismiss and not any allegations in the FAC. See\\n\\nid. (citing Afram v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Unions &amp;\\n\\nParticipating Emp’rs Health &amp; Welfare Fund, 958 F. Supp. 2d 275,\\n\\n279 n.1 (D.D.C. 2013), appeal dismissed, No. 13–7136, 2014 WL\\n\\n1378304 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 21, 2014); Briscoe v. Costco Wholesale\\n\\nCorp., 61 F. Supp. 3d 78, 83 n.2 (D.D.C. 2014)). Ms. Pool does\\n\\nnot respond to this objection. See generally Pl.’s Objs., ECF\\n\\nNo. 250-1; Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253; Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 256.\\n\\n      The Court is not persuaded that Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nerred by considering the exhibits Ms. Pool filed with her\\n\\nOpposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss. Although a court may not\\n\\n                                16\\n\fconsider new allegations raised in response to a motion to\\n\\ndismiss, see Briscoe, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 83 n. 2 (citing Sloan v.\\n\\nUrban Title Servs., Inc., 689 F. Supp. 2d 94, 114 (D.D.C.\\n\\n2010)); it also “may consider . . . any documents either\\n\\nattached to or incorporated in the complaint,” EEOC, 117 F.3d at\\n\\n624. Here, the FAC discusses the “regular invoices [Ms. Pool\\n\\nsent to CNA] for services she provided, and for the services,\\n\\nsupplies and medical providers whom she engaged to care for Mr.\\n\\nBrink’s various needs from hospitalizations, wound care,\\n\\noperations, therapy, and transportation and medical supplies” as\\n\\nwell as CNA’s payment of   “some of those invoices.” FAC, ECF No.\\n\\n214 ¶¶ 88-89. Because the FAC incorporates those invoices and\\n\\npayment records by reference, Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nappropriately considered Ms. Pool’s exhibits. See Gerlich v.\\n\\nU.S. Dep’t of Just., 659 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009).\\n\\n     In the alternative, CNA contends that Magistrate Judge\\n\\nFaruqui did not imply a reasonable time for performance under an\\n\\ninstallment contract. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 21.\\n\\nSpecifically, CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui “erred in\\n\\ndisregarding [Ms.] Pool’s own declaration, which concedes that\\n\\n‘CNA stopped paying invoices in 2007.’” Id. (quoting Pool Decl.,\\n\\nECF No. 227-2 ¶ 8). The Court disagrees with this assessment. In\\n\\nher declaration, Ms. Pool references documentation of CNA’s\\n\\npayment history. See Pool Decl., ECF No. 227-2 ¶ 8 (“attached\\n\\n                                17\\n\fspread sheet, attachment 3 hereto, showing invoicing and\\n\\npayments with interest, to today’s date that have been\\n\\nincurred”). In that exhibit, Ms. Pool states that CNA paid her\\n\\nin three-month intervals. See Ex. 3, ECF No. 227-2 at 21-22. The\\n\\nCourt therefore concludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui fairly\\n\\nimplied a three-month payment term. See R. &amp; R., ECF No. 248 at\\n\\n8 (discussing Exhibit 3).\\n\\n     Ms. Pool also objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nanalysis as to whether CNA repudiated the contract. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12. However, as CNA states in its\\n\\nOpposition, see Def.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 255 at 9; her objection\\n\\nmerely repeats her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss\\n\\nverbatim, compare Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12, with Pl.’s\\n\\nOpp’n &amp; Resp. Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No.\\n\\n227 at 15-19. Accordingly, the Court reviews this objection only\\n\\nfor clear error, see Houlahan, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 88; and\\n\\nconcludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui did not err with respect\\n\\nto his analysis in this portion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n     In sum, the Court concludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nappropriately assumed the existence of an installment contract\\n\\nand implied a three-month payment term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               18\\n\f          3.   Magistrate Judge Faruqui Correctly Disregarded\\n               Ms. Pool’s Equitable Tolling Arguments\\n\\n     Ms. Pool objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s failure to\\n\\napply the doctrine of equitable tolling to her claims. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 12-15. As with her repudiation argument,\\n\\nsee supra, her objection largely restates her Opposition to\\n\\nCNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare id., with Pl.’s Opp’n\\n\\n&amp; Resp. Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 227\\n\\nat 20-23. The Court therefore reviews Ms. Pool’s objection only\\n\\nfor clear error. See Houlahan, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 88. Finding no\\n\\nerror, the Court ADOPTS the portion of the R. &amp; R. pertaining to\\n\\nthe statute of limitations.\\n\\n     C.   Ms. Pool Adequately Pleaded a Claim for Breach of\\n          Contract\\n\\n     CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that\\n\\nMs. Pool adequately pleaded her claim for breach of contract.\\n\\nSee Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 21-25. In particular, CNA\\n\\nargues that: (1) Magistrate Judge Faruqui incorrectly considered\\n\\nevidence Ms. Pool submitted with her Opposition to its Motion to\\n\\nDismiss; (2) Ms. Pool has not alleged the existence of a\\n\\ncontract; and (3) Magistrate Judge Faruqui erred by not\\n\\nconsidering its documentary evidence. See id. For the reasons\\n\\nthat follow, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool has properly\\n\\npleaded her breach of contract claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n                               19\\n\f     CNA first contends that the Court should reject Magistrate\\n\\nJudge Faruqui’s recommendation because it “is based, in large\\n\\npart, on new allegations and documentation proffered by [Ms.]\\n\\nPool in her opposition.” Id. at 21. As the Court explained\\n\\nsupra, it was appropriate for Magistrate Judge Faruqui to\\n\\nconsider Ms. Pool’s exhibits because they are incorporated into\\n\\nthe FAC by reference. See EEOC, 117 F.3d at 624.\\n\\n     CNA next argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui should have\\n\\nrecommended dismissal because Ms. Pool has not alleged the\\n\\nexistence of a contract. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 22-24.\\n\\nIndeed, a plaintiff alleging a breach of contract must plead,\\n\\ninter alia, a valid contract between the parties. Tsintolas\\n\\nRealty Co. v. Mendez, 984 A.2d 181, 187 (D.C. 2009). Looking\\n\\nonly at the FAC and not the documents incorporated by reference,\\n\\nCNA argues that Ms. Pool has failed to allege material terms of\\n\\na contract, including: whether Ms. Pool had a contract, when the\\n\\ncontract was executed, when Ms. Pool submitted invoices, the\\n\\ndetails of her invoices, or the payment terms. See Def.’s Objs.,\\n\\nECF No. 252 at 22-23. CNA further contends that Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nallegations in the FAC suggest only: that CNA had a contractual\\n\\nrelationship with other entities; and that Ms. Pool had a\\n\\nrelationship with Mr. Brink. See id. at 23-24.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool counters that she has alleged the existence of a\\n\\ncontract. See Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 16-18. Citing the FAC,\\n\\n                               20\\n\fshe argues that she alleged: “[t]here was an agreement, CNA\\n\\nacted as if there was, [she] performed services in reliance on\\n\\nsuch, [and] CNA paid for some of the invoices (accounts\\n\\nstated).” Id. at 18. The Court agrees that Ms. Pool has\\n\\n“sufficiently allege[d] the existence of a contract, its general\\n\\nterms, and the contractual obligation that [CNA] purportedly\\n\\nviolated (i.e. failing to pay [her]).” Burnett v. Am. Fed’n of\\n\\nGov’t Emps., 102 F. Supp. 3d 183, 193 (D.D.C. 2015) (explaining\\n\\nthat “[w]hen those elements are pled, . . . courts have held\\n\\nthat plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim, despite the\\n\\notherwise imprecise or vague nature of the complaint”). In the\\n\\nFAC, she alleges an agreement—for her “to perform nursing\\n\\nservices and nurse case management services for [CNA]” and for\\n\\nCNA “to pay her for her services.” FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 154-55.\\n\\nShe also alleges the terms of the contract by describing how\\n\\nboth parties performed pursuant to that agreement. See id. ¶¶\\n\\n156-59 (describing the services Ms. Pool was bound to provide\\n\\nand the payments CNA was bound to make). The Court concludes\\n\\nbased on these allegations that Ms. Pool has adequately pleaded\\n\\nthe existence of a contract. See Burnett, 102 F. Supp. 3d at\\n\\n192-93.\\n\\n     Finally, CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s failure\\n\\nto consider the settlement agreement it entered into with Mr.\\n\\nBrink. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 24-25. The Court agrees\\n\\n                               21\\n\fwith CNA that it may take judicial notice of this record. See\\n\\nVenable LLP v. Overseas Lease Grp., Inc., No. CV 14-02010 (RJL),\\n\\n2015 WL 4555372, at *3 n.7 (D.D.C. July 28, 2015) (taking\\n\\njudicial notice of a settlement agreement in the public record).\\n\\nHowever, this settlement agreement does not alter the Court’s\\n\\nanalysis because, as with its briefing on its Motion to Dismiss,\\n\\nCNA cites no legal authority to explain why Ms. Pool is bound by\\n\\nits agreement with Mr. Brink. See generally Def.’s Objs., ECF\\n\\nNo. 252 at 24-25.\\n\\n     Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool has stated a\\n\\nclaim for breach of contract and ADOPTS this portion of the R. &amp;\\n\\nR.\\n\\n     D.   Ms. Pool Has Not Pleaded a Claim for Breach of the\\n          Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\\n\\n     Finally, Ms. Pool objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nconclusion that she has not pleaded a claim for breach of the\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 15-18.\\n\\n     Under District of Columbia law, all contracts contain an\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Nugent v. Unum\\n\\nLife Ins. Co. of Am., 752 F.Supp.2d 46, 56 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing\\n\\nAllworth v. Howard Univ., 890 A.2d 194, 201 (D.C. 2006)). A\\n\\nplaintiff alleging a claim for a breach of this implied covenant\\n\\n“must allege either bad faith or conduct that is arbitrary and\\n\\n\\n                                 22\\n\fcapricious.” Wright v. Howard Univ., 60 A.3d 749, 754 (D.C.\\n\\n2013). “Bad faith requires more than mere negligence,” such as\\n\\n“lack of diligence, purposeful failure to perform, and\\n\\ninterference with the other party’s ability to perform.” Id.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool argues that CNA’s actions “were malicious and\\n\\nintended to deceive and deprive [her] of” payment for the\\n\\nservices she rendered. See Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 16.\\n\\nCiting the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, she contends that\\n\\nthe following constitutes bad faith: evasion; agreement and\\n\\nsubsequent refusal to meet; delay of payment; and refusal to\\n\\nnegotiate with her attorney. See id. at 17.\\n\\n     CNA defends Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s determination that\\n\\nMs. Pool’s allegations are vague, conclusory, and otherwise\\n\\nduplicative of her breach of contract claim. See Def.’s Opp’n,\\n\\nECF No. 255 at 13-15. The Court agrees with CNA. Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nallegations of “evasion” and “refusal” are vague and conclusory.\\n\\nSee Ruiz v. Millennium Square Residential Ass’n, No. 1:19-cv-\\n\\n3765, 2022 WL 296200, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 1, 2022), appeal\\n\\ndocketed, No. 22-7024 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2022). Other\\n\\nallegations merely repeat the allegations she made in connection\\n\\nwith her breach of contract claim. See generally FAC, ECF No.\\n\\n214. The Court therefore is persuaded that Ms. Pool has failed\\n\\nto state a claim for a breach of the implied covenant of good\\n\\nfaith and fair dealing and ADOPTS this portion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n                               23\\n\fV.   Conclusion\\n\\n     For the foregoing reasons, the Court ADOPTS IN PART\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui’s R. &amp; R., ECF No. 248; and GRANTS IN\\n\\nPART and DENIES IN PART CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 220.

See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 25.07 (West Supp. 2021); TEX.\\nCODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 17.292 (West Supp. 2021). After Appellant was\\ndetermined to be incompetent to stand trial, he filed a pro se notice of appeal from\\nthe trial court’s interlocutory judgment of incompetency. We dismiss the appeal.\\n      As conceded in the brief filed by Appellant’s counsel and asserted by the State\\nin its motion to dismiss this appeal, we have no jurisdiction over an interlocutory\\nappeal relating to a determination of a defendant’s competency to stand trial. See\\nQueen v. State, 212 S.W.3d 619, 622–23 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, no pet.); see\\n\falso CRIM. PROC. arts. 46B.005, .011 (West 2018). Article 46B.011 specifically\\nprovides: “Neither the state nor the defendant is entitled to make an interlocutory\\nappeal relating to a determination or ruling under Article 46B.005 [Determining\\nIncompetency to Stand Trial].”             The judgment of incompetency from which\\nAppellant filed a pro se notice of appeal is an interlocutory determination of\\nincompetency made by the trial court pursuant to Article 46B.005 and, therefore, is\\nnot appealable at this time. 1 Queen, 212 S.W.3d at 622–23.\\n       Although Appellant’s counsel concedes that this court lacks jurisdiction to\\nconduct an interlocutory review of the trial court’s finding of incompetence, he\\nrequests that we review the trial court’s rulings with respect to the order of inpatient\\ntreatment and the issue of bail. These matters, however, relate to the trial court’s\\nruling under Article 46B.005 and, therefore, are not appealable. See id. at 623\\n(holding that the court of appeals had no jurisdiction but suggesting that these\\nmatters may be addressed in an application for writ of habeas corpus).\\n       We grant the State’s motion to dismiss, and we dismiss this appeal for want\\nof jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n                                                      W.

  BOWMAN, J. — In this personal restraint petition (PRP), Robert Recco\\n\\nMcMurtry claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel at a community\\n\\ncustody revocation hearing before the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board\\n\\n(ISRB). He argues the conditions imposed at the hearing unlawfully restrain him\\n\\nbecause his attorney’s deficient performance deprived him of his right to effective\\n\\nrepresentation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\n\\nBecause the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not apply at an\\n\\nadministrative hearing and McMurtry does not allege a procedural due process\\n\\nviolation, we deny McMurtry’s PRP.\\n\\n                                         FACTS\\n\\n       In 2002, McMurtry consumed alcohol and marijuana at a house party and\\n\\nsexually assaulted a stranger. The State charged him with second degree rape.\\n\\nA jury convicted McMurtry as charged, and the court sentenced him to a\\n\\n“determinate-plus”1 sentence of 78 months to life in the custody of the\\n\\n\\n\\n       1 McMurtry’s determinate-plus sentence under former RCW 9.94A.712 (2001) equates to\\nan indeterminate sentence under RCW 9.94A.507.\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/2\\n\\n\\nDepartment of Corrections (DOC). McMurtry served 73 months in confinement\\n\\nbefore DOC released him. He then began serving a lifetime of community\\n\\ncustody under the supervision of the ISRB.\\n\\n      McMurtry’s release from DOC came with conditions. The conditions\\n\\nincluded requirements that McMurtry stay each night at a residence approved by\\n\\nhis community corrections officer (CCO), notify his CCO of any change in\\n\\naddress, not possess firearms or ammunition, abstain from alcohol, and not enter\\n\\nbars, taverns, or lounges. McMurtry was also required to register as a sex\\n\\noffender.\\n\\n      In 2019, McMurtry’s CCO suspected that McMurtry was not living at his\\n\\napproved residence. After investigating, the CCO charged McMurtry with seven\\n\\ncommunity custody violations and arrested him. The CCO alleged McMurtry (1)\\n\\nchanged his residence without CCO permission, (2) failed to register as a sex\\n\\noffender at that new address, (3) possessed alcohol, (4) possessed a firearm, (5)\\n\\npossessed ammunition, (6) visited bars, and (7) stayed overnight at an\\n\\nunapproved residence.\\n\\n      The ISRB held a community custody revocation hearing on McMurtry’s\\n\\nalleged violations on October 24, 2019. At the hearing, the ISRB allowed an\\n\\nattorney to represent McMurtry. McMurtry pleaded guilty to four of the\\n\\nallegations, and the ISRB found him guilty of the other three after considering\\n\\ntestimony and other evidence. The ISRB determined that it was appropriate to\\n\\nreinstate McMurtry’s community custody rather than impose more jail time. It\\n\\nreleased McMurtry but imposed several community custody conditions. It again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                         2\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/3\\n\\n\\nordered that McMurtry stay each night at a residence approved by his CCO. And\\n\\nit imposed several new conditions, including 90 days of electronic home\\n\\nmonitoring (EHM), an 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. curfew, and 6 months of random\\n\\nurinalysis (UA) testing.\\n\\n       McMurtry timely filed this PRP.\\n\\n                                     ANALYSIS\\n\\nGrounds for Relief\\n\\n       The ISRB argues we should dismiss McMurtry’s PRP because he has no\\n\\ngrounds for relief. According to the ISRB, McMurtry is not under restraint\\n\\nbecause the conditions it imposed based on McMurtry’s community custody\\n\\nviolations “either expired . . . or are largely redundant of unchallenged,\\n\\npreviously-imposed conditions.” We disagree in part.\\n\\n       Relief through a PRP is extraordinary. In re Pers. Restraint of Coats, 173\\n\\nWn.2d 123, 132, 267 P.3d 324 (2011). To obtain relief, a petitioner must show\\n\\nthat he is currently under restraint and that the restraint is unlawful. RAP 16.4(a);\\n\\nIn re Pers. Restraint of Grantham, 168 Wn.2d 204, 213, 227 P.3d 285 (2010).\\n\\nUnder RAP 16.4(b), a petitioner is under restraint if he has limited freedom\\n\\nbecause of a criminal or civil court decision, is confined, is subject to imminent\\n\\nconfinement, or is under some other disability from a judgment or sentence in a\\n\\ncriminal case. A petitioner who is subject to community custody conditions that\\n\\nlimit his freedom is under restraint. In re Pers. Restraint of Martinez, 2 Wn. App.\\n\\n2d 904, 910, 413 P.3d 1043 (2018) (ISRB condition forbidding parolee from\\n\\nentering Thurston County was a restraint), abrogated on other grounds by In re\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          3\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/4\\n\\n\\nPers. Restraint of Winton, 196 Wn.2d 270, 474 P.3d 532 (2020).\\n\\n        After finding that McMurtry violated his conditions of community custody,\\n\\nthe ISRB ordered that McMurtry spend every night at his approved residence\\n\\nunless he obtains written permission from his CCO to stay somewhere else. This\\n\\nrequirement is the same as a previously imposed condition of release, so it does\\n\\nnot amount to new restraint. The ISRB also imposed several new conditions,\\n\\nincluding 90 days of EHM and 6 months of random UA testing, beginning\\n\\nNovember 4, 2019. Those conditions have been satisfied, so they do not\\n\\ncurrently restrain McMurtry. But the ISRB also ordered that McMurtry “be\\n\\npresent in [his] ‘registered’ residence every night between the hours of 11 PM\\n\\nand 5 AM.” That condition has not expired and restrains McMurtry beyond those\\n\\nconditions previously imposed. As a result, McMurtry is under restraint and may\\n\\nseek relief of the curfew condition through a PRP.2\\n\\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\\n\\n        McMurtry contends that his restraint is unlawful because his attorney was\\n\\nineffective at his ISRB hearing. He urges us to evaluate his claim under the Sixth\\n\\nAmendment Strickland3 test. Allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel\\n\\npresent mixed questions of fact and law that we review de novo. State v.\\n\\nSutherby, 165 Wn.2d 870, 883, 204 P.3d 916 (2009).\\n\\n\\n\\n        2 In McMurtry’s reply, he asserts he is also under restraint because of the “severe impact\\nthe [seven] different guilty findings will have on any future decisions made by his DOC officers\\nand the ISRB for the remainder of his lifetime supervision by the [ISRB].” He cites no cases in\\nsupport of that proposition, so we do not consider it. RAP 10.3(a)(6); Cowiche Canyon\\nConservancy v. Bosley, 118 Wn.2d 801, 809, 828 P.2d 549 (1992) (we do not consider argument\\nunsupported by citation to authority).\\n        3   Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).\\n\\n\\n                                                  4\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/5\\n\\n\\n       The Sixth Amendment and article I, section 22 of the Washington State\\n\\nConstitution guarantee defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel in\\n\\na criminal prosecution. The focus of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is\\n\\n“whether the event for which the defendant argues counsel is necessary is a\\n\\n‘critical stage’ of the criminal prosecution.” Grisby v. Herzog, 190 Wn. App. 786,\\n\\n796, 362 P.3d 763 (2015). When a defendant alleges ineffective assistance of\\n\\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment, we apply the two-part test established in\\n\\nStrickland to analyze the claim. 466 U.S. at 687. That is, we consider whether\\n\\nthe defendant’s counsel was deficient, and if so, whether that deficient\\n\\nperformance prejudiced the defendant. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\\n\\n       But revocation of a postconviction status like community custody is not a\\n\\ncritical stage of a criminal proceeding. A parole revocation hearing is\\n\\nadministrative, not criminal, and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not\\n\\nattach. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 781, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656\\n\\n(1973); Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at 796. Because a parolee4 has no Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to counsel at an ISRB hearing, the Strickland test does not\\n\\napply. See State v. Grier, 171 Wn.2d 17, 32, 246 P.3d 1260 (2011) (“In\\n\\nStrickland, the United States Supreme Court set forth the prevailing standard\\n\\nunder the Sixth Amendment for reversal of criminal convictions based on\\n\\nineffective assistance of counsel.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       4 Community custody in Washington amounts to parole. See Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at\\n800-01 (citing In re Pers. Restraint Petition of McNeal, 99 Wn. App. 617, 633, 994 P.2d 890\\n(2000)).\\n\\n\\n                                              5\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/6\\n\\n\\n       Even so, a postconviction revocation hearing can lead to a parolee’s loss\\n\\nof liberty, so we have determined that a parolee may have a right to counsel at\\n\\nsuch a hearing when necessary to protect procedural due process under the\\n\\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 3\\n\\nof the Washington State Constitution. Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at 789 (the\\n\\nprocedural protection due to someone who faces revocation of community\\n\\ncustody status includes, in some cases, the right to counsel at the revocation\\n\\nhearing). It is the responsibility of the correctional authority conducting the\\n\\ncommunity custody hearing to determine, case by case, whether appointment of\\n\\ncounsel is necessary to protect a parolee’s procedural due process rights.\\n\\nScarpelli, 411 U.S. at 790; Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at 798, 805-06. In doing so, the\\n\\ncorrectional authority considers factors like whether the parolee requested\\n\\ncounsel, whether the parolee appears able to speak effectively for himself, and\\n\\nwhether the case is complex or difficult to develop or present. Scarpelli, 411 U.S.\\n\\nat 790-91.\\n\\n       McMurtry asserts no due process claims in his PRP. Instead, he broadly\\n\\ndeclares that a “parolee has a state and federal constitutional right to effective\\n\\nassistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Const. and article\\n\\nI, section 22 of the Washington State Constitution once the [ISRB] has deemed\\n\\nthat the parolee may have the assistance of counsel.” In support, he cites State\\n\\nv. Estes, 188 Wn.2d 450, 457, 395 P.3d 1045 (2017); Scarpelli, 411 U.S. at 782;\\n\\nand Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at 805. But none of those cases holds that a Sixth\\n\\nAmendment right to counsel attaches at a postconviction hearing. Estes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                          6\\n\fNo. 82141-5-I/7\\n\\n\\nanalyzes whether trial counsel was ineffective during the plea bargaining\\n\\nprocess. 188 Wn.2d at 453-54. And the other two cases recognize that any right\\n\\nto counsel at a postconviction hearing arises from the due process clause of the\\n\\nFourteenth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. at 781-\\n\\n83; Grisby, 190 Wn. App. at 795-96.\\n\\n      Because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach to an\\n\\nadministrative hearing and McMurtry asserts no procedural due process claim,\\n\\nwe deny McMurtry’s PRP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWE CONCUR:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        7\\n\f\n",

                           In The\\n                            Court of Appeals\\n                     Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\\n                               No. 05-21-00752-CR\\n\\n                EX PARTE JOHN NATHANIEL THOMPSON\\n\\n               On Appeal from the 219th Judicial District Court\\n                            Collin County, Texas\\n                   Trial Court Cause No. 219-80629-2021\\n\\n                        MEMORANDUM OPINION\\n              Before Justices Schenck, Osborne, and Partida-Kipness\\n                            Opinion by Justice Osborne\\n      John Nathaniel Thompson has filed a notice of appeal stating he is appealing\\n\\n“the trial court’s judgment rendered on August 16, 2021.” After reviewing the\\n\\nrecord, we conclude we do not have jurisdiction to review this case.\\n\\n      The clerk’s record shows that, although he is represented by counsel, appellant\\n\\nfiled both a pro se motion to reduce his bond and a pro se application for writ of\\n\\nhabeas corpus seeking a bond. The clerk’s record does not contain a final, written\\n\\norder ruling on either the bond reduction motion or the application for writ of habeas\\n\\ncorpus. According to the trial court’s docket sheet, the trial court conducted a “bond\\n\\nhearing” on August 16, 2021 and denied a “bond reduction.”\\n\f      The reporter’s record shows the trial court conducted a pretrial hearing on\\n\\nAugust 16, 2021 to review appellant’s bonds in three cases, including the current\\n\\none. The trial court stated it was its “understanding that we have a request today to\\n\\nlower the bond amounts.” Trial counsel represented appellant during the hearing\\n\\nand advocated for a lower bond. Trial counsel called appellant to testify.\\n\\n      During his testimony, appellant testified about his connections to Collin\\n\\nCounty and his criminal history. Appellant admitted he had been released on bond\\n\\nfor the current state jail felony offense for possession of methamphetamine in an\\n\\namount less than one gram and for a second misdemeanor drug possession offense.\\n\\nHe was taken into custody again after his bond company had filed an Affidavit of\\n\\nSurety to Surrender Principal asking to surrender him to the Collin County Sheriff.\\n\\nAccording to the affidavit, appellant was not checking in or updating the bond\\n\\ncompany about his address and attempts to contact him had been unsuccessful.\\n\\nAppellant also testified he was arrested and charged with two new offenses for\\n\\nevidence tampering in Dallas County and first-degree felony drug possession in\\n\\nCollin County.\\n\\n      After hearing the evidence, the trial court ruled: “I do have serious concerns,\\n\\nMr. Thompson, because of how many times you’ve been out on bond and you’ve\\n\\nalready had your bonding company going off of it once with additional allegations\\n\\nof crimes being committed while out on bond. So the request to lower bond is\\n\\ndenied.”\\n\\n                                        –2–\\n\f      Appellant may appeal the denial of habeas relief, but the Court does not have\\n\\njurisdiction to entertain an appeal from denial of a motion to reduce a pretrial bond.\\n\\nSee Ragston v.

Nothing in the reporter’s record from the hearing shows\\n\\nthe trial court ever entertained appellant’s application for a writ of habeas corpus.\\n\\nThe words “habeas” and “writ” were never mentioned during the August 16, 2021\\n\\nhearing. The trial court orally denied a “request” to reduce appellant’s bonds—a\\n\\nruling that appears to deny appellant’s pro se motion to reduce his bonds rather than\\n\\nto deny habeas relief. Moreover, the trial court has not entered any written orders in\\n\\nthis case on either matter.\\n\\n      The Court solicited jurisdictional letter briefs from appellant and the State to\\n\\naddress the jurisdictional issues in this case. Appellant filed a pro se letter requesting\\n\\nthat his writ application be granted or denied, a short brief arguing the trial court\\n\\nerred in not granting habeas relief, a new habeas application addressed to the trial\\n\\ncourt, a request to the trial court to reduce his bonds, and a motion to compel the trial\\n\\ncourt to enter a final, written order on his habeas application. The State did not file\\n\\na response. None of the documents appellant filed shows this Court has jurisdiction\\n\\nover this appeal.\\n\\n      Because the record does not show the trial court ever considered the habeas\\n\\napplication, and further does not show the trial court has entered an appealable order,\\n\\nappellant’s notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction upon the Court.

Smith (“Smith”), appeals from a July 21, 2020\\n\\njudgment entered after a non-jury trial before the Court of Common Pleas of\\n\\nClearfield County granting Appellee, Gasbarre Products, Inc. (“the Company”),\\n\\nspecific performance of a document signed by both parties. The trial court\\n\\nconcluded that the document was an enforceable contract between them. At\\n\\nissue is whether the trial court erred in finding an enforceable agreement\\n\\nbetween the parties and, if so, whether the trial court erred in its application\\n\\nof the parol evidence rule to find that the document resolved settlement of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n*   Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nAppellant’s loan shareholder account with the Company.        After review, we\\n\\naffirm.1\\n\\n                    I.     Factual & Procedural Background\\n\\n       Smith worked as a divisional president at the Company for 18 years. In\\n\\n2017, he and CEO Thomas Gasbarre (“Gasbarre”) entered into discussions\\n\\nregarding Smith’s retirement from the Company and his withdrawal from the\\n\\nCompany’s board of directors. These talks included the process by which the\\n\\nCompany would buy back Smith’s stock and pay out money from his\\n\\nshareholder loan account. Smith retired at the end of 2017.\\n\\n       On January 11, 2018, Smith and Gasbarre met privately to negotiate\\n\\nfurther. At some point prior to the conclusion of the meeting, Gasbarre drafted\\n\\na one-page document titled “Steve Smith/Gasbarre Products, Inc. Stock\\n\\nBuyout Structure Outline.”        The third paragraph addressed the buyback of\\n\\nSmith’s stock in the company and provided, “Selling Price – . . . 251 Shares\\n\\nat $895.92/share for a total of $224,875.92.”      Company Ex. 1 (emphasis in\\n\\noriginal). Also of relevance, the tenth paragraph provided:\\n\\n           Severance/Consulting – Steve agrees to remain available\\n           for consultation on an as-needed basis from January 7, 2018\\n           through April 14, 2018. Compensation will be at Steve’s\\n           departing salary for the consulting period (8 paychecks from\\n           January 25, 2018 through May 3, 2018). Total Net Pay for\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n1 Smith filed a separate action seeking recovery of the full amount of his\\nshareholder loan account. See Smith v. Gasbarre Products, Inc., 2019-\\n1531-CD (C.C.P. Clearfield 2019). The trial court refused to consolidate that\\naction with these proceedings and stayed that case pending the outcome of\\nthis appeal.\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n         the consulting period will be $78,954 (number of paychecks\\n         to be adjusted as necessary).\\n\\nId. (emphasis in original). Gasbarre signed the bottom left-hand margin of\\n\\nthe document with his full signature; Smith wrote “SK Smith” in the bottom\\n\\nright-hand margin. See id. The Company claimed the parties entered into a\\n\\nbinding contract.   Smith argued the outline merely identified issues to be\\n\\nresolved in future discussions.\\n\\n      “In the course of the following weeks, several e-mails were exchanged\\n\\nbetween the parties discussing potential changes, including date of payment\\n\\nfor consulting/severance payments.” Trial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 1. The\\n\\nCompany’s attorneys then prepared a formal document that included these\\n\\nchanges in terms. “The agreement was to be signed on January 30, 2018;\\n\\nhowever, the agreement was never signed, and [Smith] did not surrender his\\n\\nstock to [the Company].” Id. at 1-2.\\n\\n      According to the Company, it sent Smith checks for $224,857.92 and\\n\\n$78,954.00, representing what it believed the Company owed Smith for the\\n\\nbuyout of his stock and the money in his shareholder loan account,\\n\\nrespectively. See Complaint at 4. The Company claimed Smith refused to\\n\\ncash those checks or to return his stock certificates. Smith “denied that [the\\n\\nCompany] ever tendered this payment.” Trial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 3.\\n\\nFurthermore, he “denied the existence of any binding contract.” Id. Smith\\n\\n“also pleaded he is entitled to further payment and interest on the loan [he]\\n\\nmade to his shareholder account.” Id. at 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    -3-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\n      On August 2, 2018, the Company sued Smith for specific performance.\\n\\nThe Complaint requested that the trial court order Smith to “tender his 251\\n\\nshares of stock to [the Company] in consideration for the sum of $224,875.92”\\n\\nand decree “that the sum of $78,954.00 tendered by [the Company] to\\n\\n[Smith] constitutes full and final payment of all non-stock purchase money\\n\\nowed to [Smith] under the Agreement of January 11, 2018[.]” Id. at 5. The\\n\\nCompany also requested an injunction. Following an injunction hearing, the\\n\\ntrial court found no “disagreement between the parties over the value of\\n\\n[Smith’s] stock or that [he] would indeed tender the stock back to [the\\n\\nCompany].”    Trial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 2. Also, “the parties agreed\\n\\nupon . . . an order granting a preliminary injunction ordering [Smith] to\\n\\nsurrender [his] shares of stock . . . for the agreed upon price of $224,875.92\\n\\n. . . subject to oral stipulations entered on the record” by the parties. Id.\\n\\n“Accordingly, [Smith] tendered his stock, [the Company] made the payment\\n\\nto [him,] and the stock issue was settled.” Id. at 3. One question remained\\n\\nunresolved: How much money, if any, did the Company owe Smith from his\\n\\nshareholder loan account?\\n\\n      On October 25, 2019, Smith moved for summary judgment.                He\\n\\ncontended that, even though the Company sought “as its sole remedy that\\n\\nthe court direct specific performance of the Stock Buyout Structure Outline, it\\n\\nis clear that [the Company’s] claim is based in assumpsit, resulting from\\n\\n[Smith’s] alleged breach of the Stock Buyout Structure Outline.”       Smith’s\\n\\nMotion for Summary Judgment at 6.       Therefore, Smith contended that the\\n\\n                                     -4-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\ncompany had an adequate remedy at law and the court lacked equitable\\n\\njurisdiction. The trial court did not address the merits of Smith’s motion for\\n\\nsummary judgment.           Instead, it dismissed the motion as untimely and in\\n\\nviolation of Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2, which provides that a motion for summary\\n\\njudgment shall be filed “within such time as not to unreasonably delay trial.”\\n\\nThe trial court concluded it had “insufficient time available to correctly process\\n\\n[the motion]” in advance of the trial scheduled for November 6, 2019. Trial\\n\\nCourt Order, 10/25/19, at 1.\\n\\n          Gasbarre and Smith both testified at the November 6, 2019 bench trial.\\n\\nGasbarre explained how the parties arrived at the Stock Buyout Structure\\n\\nOutline (hereinafter referred to as “the Outline”) and why it constituted a\\n\\ncontract between the parties. Smith asserted that the document constituted\\n\\na memorandum reflecting the issues a future contract should address and\\n\\nargued he simply initialed the document rather than sign it with his full\\n\\nsignature.2 Gasbarre also testified as to the true meaning and purpose of the\\n\\nlanguage       in   the   Outline,   and   in   particular   Paragraph   10,   entitled\\n\\n“Severance/Consulting.” Company Ex. 1.\\n\\n          The exchange between Gasbarre and his counsel was as follows:\\n\\n     Q:      Now, let’s go down to paragraph 10.               That deals with\\n             severance consulting?\\n\\n     A:      Yes.\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n2   The document is signed “SK Smith.”\\n\\n                                           -5-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n   Q:    It’s been pointed out on many occasions in [prior] cross\\n         examination that this paragraph says nothing about\\n         shareholder loan account?\\n\\n   A:    That’s correct.\\n\\n   Q:    Is there any doubt in your mind that this paragraph, that you\\n         imposed, was intended to address Mr. Smith’s Shareholder-\\n         Loan Account?\\n\\n   A:    Absolutely not.\\n\\n   ...\\n\\n   Q.    So this is characterized as a severance/consulting agreement.\\n         Is there a reason why it’s characterized as that?\\n\\n   A.    Yes. We – again, we were negotiating the final terms, which\\n         included the loans from shareholders. Just as we negotiated\\n         the 60[-]month payments instead of 120-month payments\\n         [for the stock repurchase], we were also trying to facilitate the\\n         payout of that one-half of the loans from shareholders that we\\n         had agreed on. The easiest way to facilitate that, both in Mr.\\n         Smith’s favor, as well as to the benefit of Gasbarre Products,\\n         was the fact that he was still on the payroll records. That we\\n         would pay it out as a severance/consulting fee, through the\\n         payroll process. It was simply to facilitate, that is the reason\\n         for the wording, which is exactly why it’s one-half of the loans\\n         from shareholders account.\\n\\n         But not only that, more importantly, it was netted up, which\\n         you normally don’t do through the payroll system. It was\\n         netted up, because the loans from shareholders is paid out tax\\n         free. If we simply paid it as a severance/consulting fee, it\\n         wouldn’t have been netted out, and he’d have to pay taxes.\\n         So we netted it up so he got precisely one-half of the loan from\\n         shareholders. It’s worded very carefully in that matter.\\n\\nNotes of Testimony, 11/6/19, at 25-28. According to Gasbarre, the parties\\n\\nintended the words “severance/consulting” in the writing to mean one-half of\\n\\nSmith’s shareholder loan account. They deliberately omitted any reference to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     -6-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir agreement on the shareholder loan account to avoid tax consequences\\n\\nthat neither party desired.\\n\\n      By opinion and order entered March 10, 2020, the trial court granted\\n\\nthe Company full relief.      The court made a factual finding that “[a]n\\n\\nenforceable contract exists between Gasbarre Products, Inc. and Steven K.\\n\\nSmith as is set forth in the Outline of January 11, 2018.” Trial Court Order,\\n\\n3/10/20, at 1. It further ordered the parties “to follow the terms of the Outline\\n\\nfrom January 11, 2018.” Id. Finally, the court directed Smith “to accept the\\n\\namount of $78,954.00 by Gasbarre Products, Inc. as full and final payment\\n\\nfor retirement compensation and/or any loan [Smith] made to his shareholder\\n\\naccount.” Id. In its opinion, the trial court explained its directive to accept\\n\\npayment, stating, “Clearly the remedy of specific performance was the only\\n\\none available to [the Company] regarding . . . the parties’ compromise that\\n\\npursuant to paragraph 10 of the January 11, 2018 Agreement [the Company]\\n\\nwould pay $78,854.00 to [Smith].” Trial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 7. The\\n\\ncourt determined that the amount stated in paragraph 10 of the writing “was\\n\\nclearly in full satisfaction of [Smith’s] claim that he was owed on the loan to\\n\\nhis shareholder account.” Id.\\n\\n      On March 24, 2020, Smith filed a motion for post-trial relief and a notice\\n\\nof appeal to this Court.   By order entered May 27, 2020, we quashed the\\n\\nappeal as prematurely filed. See Gasbarre Products, Inc. v. Smith, 431\\n\\nWDA 2020 (Pa. Super. 2020). On July 16, 2020, the trial court dismissed\\n\\nSmith’s motion for post-trial relief. On July 21, 2020, judgment was entered\\n\\n                                      -7-\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nin favor of the Company. This timely appeal followed. Both Smith and the\\n\\ntrial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.3\\n\\n                                    II.        Analysis\\n\\n       Smith raises five issues, which we have reordered below for ease of\\n\\ndisposition:\\n\\n       1.      Whether the trial court committed clear error in denying\\n               [Smith] his right to a trial by jury.\\n\\n       2.      Whether the trial court committed clear error in granting\\n               equitable relief to [the Company], by directing [Smith] to\\n               accept the sum of $78,954.00 to dispose of the entire\\n               balance of [Smith’s] shareholder loan account, which\\n               indisputably had accrued a total balance of $157,908.00,\\n               when [the Company] maintains an adequate remedy at law\\n               (i.e., an action in assumpsit).\\n\\n       3.

The action converted to a contract dispute at law over\\n\\nthe monetary damages from the shareholder loan account. Appellant’s Brief\\n\\nat 42. Smith contends that, “[a]s a breach of contract action, [he] maintains\\n\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n4 Our constitution provides, “Trial by jury shall be as heretofore and the right\\nthereof remain inviolate.” Pa. Const. art. I, § 6. The Framers of this clause\\n“looked to preservation, not extension. It is the old right, whatever it was,\\nthe one previously enjoyed, that must remain inviolable . . . .” Byers v.\\nCommonwealth, 42 Pa. 89, 94 (1862). Our Supreme Court has held that\\nthe right to a jury trial encompasses only legal (as opposed to equitable)\\ncauses of action that existed when the 1790 Constitution went into effect.\\nSee Wertz v. Chapman Township, 741 A.2d 1272, 1275–76 (Pa. 1999)\\n(finding no right to jury trial under Pennsylvania Human Relations Act,\\nbecause the statute that created the cause of action did not grant that right\\nand no such cause of action existed in 1790); Commonwealth v.

The suit was not transformed into a\\n\\nbreach of contract action seeking money damages after the stock repurchase\\n\\nissue was resolved.\\n\\n      As the Company observed:\\n\\n      Presently, [the Company] does not seek a remedy in money\\n      damages for breach of contract; rather, [the Company] was\\n      granted the equitable relief of specific performance to enforce\\n      the terms of the retirement contract by compelling Smith to\\n      accept the tendered buyout payment in exchange for return of his\\n      stock, and in full settlement of his retirement compensation.\\n\\n\\nAppellee’s Brief at 29 (emphasis in original). Once the stock repurchase issue\\n\\nwas resolved, the Company’s action remained an action seeking specific\\n\\nperformance of the terms of the Outline by which Smith agreed to accept\\n\\ncompensation for his availability for consulting services.    As the trial court\\n\\nrecognized, “Clearly the remedy of specific performance was the only one\\n\\navailable to [the Company] regarding the stock, as well as the parties’\\n\\ncompromise that pursuant to paragraph 10 of the January 11, 2018\\n\\nAgreement [the Company] would pay $78,854.00 to [Smith].” Trial\\n\\nCourt Opinion, 3/10/20, at 7 (emphasis added).      Smith was not denied a\\n\\nconstitutional right to a jury trial because no such right existed.      As the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    - 10 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nCompany submits, while Pa.R.C.P. 1038.35 provides for a permissive jury trial\\n\\non claims for equitable relief, “[t]here is no evidence or documentation of\\n\\nrecord to support a finding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\\n\\na jury trial.” Appellee’s Brief at 32-33. The trial court did not commit error\\n\\nof law in denying Smith a jury trial. Smith is not entitled to any relief on his\\n\\nfirst issue.\\n\\n                     Issue 2 - The Grant of Equitable Relief\\n\\n        Next, according to Smith, the trial court “committed clear error by\\n\\ngranting       equitable   relief   to   the   Company   in   the   form   of   specific\\n\\nperformance[.]” Appellant’s Brief at 41. He argues that the trial court’s grant\\n\\nof “specific performance was not appropriate[, because] the Company\\n\\nmaintains an adequate remedy at law for breach of contract, and thus specific\\n\\nperformance is not a proper remedy.” Id. at 42.\\n\\n        Smith raised this issue in his summary judgment motion, asserting the\\n\\nCompany’s action should be dismissed for want of equity jurisdiction.\\n\\nHowever, as the trial court recognized, in his motion, Smith “relied on an\\n\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n5   Rule 1038.3 (Equitable Relief. Advisory Verdict by Jury) provides:\\n\\n        In any case in which there is a claim for equitable relief, the court\\n        on its own motion or upon the petition of any party may submit\\n        to trial by jury any or all issues of fact arising from that claim.\\n        The advisory verdict of the jury shall be in the form of answers to\\n        specific questions and shall not be binding upon the court.\\n\\nPa.R.C.P. 1038.3.\\n\\n                                           - 11 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\noutdated authority—the most recent case citation having issued in 1996—in\\n\\narguing the lack of equity jurisdiction.” Supplemental Opinion, 9/11/20, at 3.\\n\\n      We reject—as did the trial court—Smith’s attempt to couch this issue as\\n\\njurisdictional. As the trial court explained:\\n\\n      Pursuant to amendment to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil\\n      Procedure effective July 1, 2004, the separate form of action in\\n      equity has been abolished and the rules governing civil actions\\n      have been amended to include equitable relief. The consolidated\\n      civil action allows the court to grant the relief to which a party is\\n      entitled, whether legal or equitable. Pa.R.C.P. 1501 (rescinded)\\n      (Note: The action in equity has been abolished. Equitable relief\\n      may be obtained through a civil action . . .”.)\\n\\n      Under the consolidated civil action, there is no longer a law side\\n      and [an] equity side. “There is simply ‘the court’ which is\\n      empowered to grant appropriate relief whether legal or equitable.”\\n      Pa.R.C.P. Equitable Relief—No. Refs and Annos—Explanatory\\n      Comment 2003. [The Company] seeks equitable relief for specific\\n      performance of a contract. Accordingly, [Smith’s] motion to\\n      dismiss for lack of equity jurisdiction was inappropriately brought\\n      in this case, untimely, and completely lacking in merit.\\n\\nId. 4 (footnote omitted).\\n\\n      We agree with the trial court that there are not separate courts of law\\n\\nand equity with separate subject matter jurisdictions and further agree that\\n\\nSmith’s jurisdictional challenge lacks merit. Smith is not entitled to relief on\\n\\nhis second issue.\\n\\n       Issue 3 - Factual Finding of a January 11, 2018 Contract\\n\\n      We now turn to the trial court’s finding that the Company and Smith\\n\\nentered into a contract on January 11, 2018, which they reduced to a writing—\\n\\ni.e., the Stock Buyout Structure Outline (“the Outline”). Smith contends that,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     - 12 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nas a matter of law, there was insufficient evidence of record to support that\\n\\nfactual determination.\\n\\n      In Smith’s view, “it is clear that the minds of [the parties] did not meet\\n\\nupon all the terms necessary to form the basis of a binding contract.”\\n\\nAppellant’s Brief at 27. Smith claims the evidence establishes that, after the\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018 meeting, “a proposed full and final agreement was\\n\\neventually produced by the Company’s counsel, and that the proposed full and\\n\\nfinal agreement contained terms that were materially different from those\\n\\nfound in the Outline.” Id. at 22. He points to his own testimony that he\\n\\nconsulted his tax adviser and attorney following the January 11, 2018 meeting\\n\\nas proof that the Outline was merely a list of subjects for future negotiations,\\n\\nrather than a final contract. Id. at 33.\\n\\n      When reviewing the denial of post-trial relief following a non-jury trial,\\n\\nwe are to determine only “whether the findings of the trial court are supported\\n\\nby competent evidence and whether the trial court committed error in any\\n\\napplication of the law.” Stephan v. Waldron Elec. Heating & Cooling LLC,\\n\\n100 A.3d 660, 664 (Pa. Super. 2014) (quoting Wyatt, Inc. v. Citizens Bank\\n\\nof Pennsylvania, 976 A.2d 557, 564 (Pa. Super. 2009)). “The findings of\\n\\nfact of the trial judge must be given the same weight and effect on appeal as\\n\\nthe verdict of a jury. We consider the evidence in a light most favorable to\\n\\nthe verdict winner.” Id. Moreover, we are mindful that “the trial judge, as\\n\\nfinder of fact, is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence, and this\\n\\nCourt will not disturb his credibility determinations.” Williams v. Taylor, 188\\n\\n                                     - 13 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nA.3d 447, 450 (Pa. Super. 2018). Accordingly, “[w]e will reverse the trial\\n\\ncourt only if its findings of fact are not supported by competent evidence in\\n\\nthe record or if its findings are premised on an error of law. However, where\\n\\nthe issue concerns a question of law, our scope of review is plenary.”\\n\\nStephan, 100 A.3d at 664-65 (some punctuation omitted).\\n\\n      For an enforceable agreement to exist, the plaintiff must prove all\\n\\nessential elements of a contract by a preponderance of the evidence. “It is\\n\\nblack letter law that in order to form an enforceable contract, there must be\\n\\nan offer, acceptance, consideration or mutual meeting of the minds.” Jenkins\\n\\nv. Cty. of Schuylkill, 658 A.2d 380, 383 (Pa. Super. 1995).        “Absent a\\n\\nmanifestation of an intent to be bound . . . negotiations concerning the terms\\n\\nof a possible future contract do not result in an enforceable agreement.”\\n\\nPhilmar Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. York Street Associates II, 566 A.2d 1253,\\n\\n1255 (Pa. Super. 1989).\\n\\n      Smith believes that the Outline reflects terms of a possible future\\n\\ncontract. However, his subjective belief is irrelevant. “Because a court is\\n\\nconstrained to construe the parties’ contract based on the parties’ outward\\n\\nand objective actions — particularly, the plain terms of their written\\n\\nagreement — a subjective, or ‘true and actual,’ meeting of the minds is not\\n\\nnecessary for an enforceable contract to form.” Nicholas v. Hofmann, 158\\n\\nA.3d 675, 693 (Pa. Super. 2017) (emphasis added).\\n\\n      Here, objectively speaking, Smith and the Company had been discussing\\n\\nSmith’s departure from the company for nearly a year by the time of the\\n\\n                                    - 14 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2018 meeting. Indeed, the parties already had agreed that Smith\\n\\nwas no longer in the company’s employ as of December 31, 2017. Thus, the\\n\\nparties met in early January 2018 to resolve other issues, such as Smith\\n\\nreturning his stock shares and the payout, if any, from his shareholder loan\\n\\naccount. See N.T., 11/6/19, at 15-16, 18. Gasbarre testified that once the\\n\\nparties had established that the valuation of the stock would be the Company’s\\n\\n2017 valuation, their “only other discussion was the loans from shareholders\\n\\nand that’s what [they] were negotiating up until January 11[.]” Id. at 19.\\n\\n      Smith argued he should receive the full book value of the shareholder\\n\\nloan account of $157,907.00. The Company disagreed, taking the position\\n\\nthat the account payout was subject to negotiation, as had been the\\n\\ncompany’s past practice with other shareholders. Gasbarre further testified\\n\\nthat the parties reached an agreement in the January 11, 2018 meeting\\n\\nregarding this issue. See id. at 23. He stated that the parties compromised\\n\\n“at exactly one half of the loans from shareholder’s balance,” and that their\\n\\nagreement was put in writing in the Outline, which he authored. Id. at 23-\\n\\n24. He further testified that both parties signed that document. Id. at 24.\\n\\n      The Outline identifies the Company as the buyer of Smith’s stock. It\\n\\nsets the effective date of the sale and the price per share, based upon “the\\n\\nindependent valuation as of July 31, 2017 and dated December 1, 2017 by\\n\\nAllegheny Financial Forensics.” Company Ex. 1. The Outline also dictates the\\n\\npayment terms for the shares, allows for early payment, continues Smith’s\\n\\nlife insurance for the agreement’s duration, anticipates a non-competition and\\n\\n                                    - 15 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nconfidentiality clause without relating specific terms, obligates the company\\n\\nto cover Smith’s taxes for Company operations ending 7/31/17, confirms\\n\\ndates of Smith’s retirement and resignation from the Board of Directors,\\n\\nincludes a clause on “Severance/Consulting” through April 14, 2018 with a net\\n\\npayment of $78,954.00 for the consulting period based on Smith’s departing\\n\\nsalary, and charges the Company’s attorneys with preparation of necessary\\n\\ndocumentation for the agreement at the Company’s expense. Id. The Outline\\n\\nis replete with defined, essential terms that establish the rights and duties of\\n\\nthe parties.\\n\\n      Based on the foregoing, the Company presented sufficient evidence\\n\\nupon which the trial court could find that the parties reached a meeting of the\\n\\nminds on January 11, 2018, and that the Outline was the written product of\\n\\ntheir agreement. While reasonable minds could differ on this question, one\\n\\nmay infer from Gasbarre’s recollection of events and from Smith’s signature\\n\\non the Outline that the parties agreed to its terms. The trial court’s finding\\n\\nthat there was a meeting of the minds finds support in the record, a finding\\n\\nwe are not free to disregard.\\n\\n      Smith’s argument that he only initialed, rather than signed, the\\n\\ndocument is of no moment, as the trial judge, as finder of fact, was “free to\\n\\nbelieve all, part, or none of the evidence, and this Court will not disturb his\\n\\ncredibility determinations.” Williams, 188 A.3d at 450. In finding that an\\n\\nenforceable agreement existed between the parties, the trial court placed no\\n\\nsignificance on the fact Smith signed the Outline as “SK Smith,” as confirmed\\n\\n                                     - 16 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nby the trial court’s statement that the Outline “was created and signed by”\\n\\nGasbarre and Smith. Trial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 1. Simply stated, the\\n\\ntrial court rejected Smith’s version of the facts in finding that an enforceable\\n\\nagreement existed between the parties.\\n\\n      Where, as here, “the evidence is conflicting as to whether the parties\\n\\nintended that a particular writing would constitute a complete expression of\\n\\ntheir agreement it . . . is a question of fact for the trier of fact to determine\\n\\nwhether a contract exists.” Field v. Golden Triangle Broad., Inc., 305 A.2d\\n\\n689, 691 (Pa. 1973). Because the trial judge concluded that the January 11,\\n\\n2018 Outline was intended by the parties to be a valid, binding contract, we\\n\\nwill not reverse his finding. See Field, 305 A.2d at 692 (where factfinder\\n\\ndetermined that letter agreement was intended by the parties to be a valid,\\n\\nbinding contract, Supreme Court will not reverse that finding).          Smith’s\\n\\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence proving that the parties entered a\\n\\nwritten contract warrants no relief.\\n\\n Issues 4 and 5 - Parol Evidence and the Shareholder Loan Account\\n\\n      Finally, we address Smith’s challenge to the trial court’s conclusion that\\n\\nthe Outline governs the company’s final payment from his shareholder loan\\n\\naccount. He argues the trial court violated the parol evidence rule in reaching\\n\\nthat conclusion. Smith contends that without the testimony of Gasbarre to\\n\\nvary the unambiguous language of the writing, the document does not make\\n\\nany reference to the shareholder loan account, much less require him to\\n\\naccept 50% of it as a full and final payment.\\n\\n                                       - 17 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\n      The Company agrees with Smith that the Outline’s “terms are clear and\\n\\nunambiguous[.]” Appellee’s Brief at 25. However, it contends that the trial\\n\\ncourt “did not err in admitting parol evidence to assist in determining whether\\n\\nthe parties intended the writing to be a complete embodiment of their\\n\\nagreement.” Id. at 26 (citing Lenzi v. Hahnemann University, 664 A.2d\\n\\n1375, 1379-80 (Pa. Super. 1995)).\\n\\n      The trial court did not specifically address its admission of parol evidence\\n\\nin either its March 10, 2020 opinion or its September 11, 2020 supplemental\\n\\nopinion.    Instead, the court focused on whether the Outline constituted a\\n\\ncontract and whether there was a meeting of the minds to support a finding\\n\\nthat a contract existed.    While we do not disagree with the trial court’s\\n\\ndetermination that a contract was formed, further discussion is warranted with\\n\\nrespect to whether the trial court properly admitted and considered parol\\n\\nevidence.\\n\\n      We note initially that “our standard of review regarding the challenge to\\n\\nthe admissibility of evidence is very narrow; we will only reverse a ruling of\\n\\nthe trial court if there is an abuse of discretion or error of law.”        Kehr\\n\\nPackages, Inc. v. Fidelity Bank, Nat. Ass’n, 710 A.2d 1169, 1172 (Pa.\\n\\nSuper. 1998) (citation omitted).\\n\\n      In DeArmitt v. New York Life Ins. Co., 73 A.3d 578 (Pa. Super.\\n\\n2013), this Court explained:\\n\\n      Pennsylvania law defines the parol evidence rule as:\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     - 18 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n         Where the parties, without any fraud or mistake, have\\n         deliberately put their engagements in writing, the law\\n         declares the writing to be not only the best, but the only,\\n         evidence of their agreement. All preliminary negotiations,\\n         conversations and verbal agreements are merged in and\\n         superseded by the subsequent written contract . . . and\\n         unless fraud, accident or mistake be averred, the writing\\n         constitutes the agreement between the parties, and its\\n         terms and agreements cannot be added to nor subtracted\\n         from by parol evidence.\\n\\n      Yocca v. Pittsburgh Steelers Sports, Inc., 578 Pa. 479, 497,\\n      854 A.2d 425, 436 (2004) (quoting Gianni v. R. Russel & Co.,\\n      281 Pa. 320, 323, 126 A. 791, 792 (1924)). The parol evidence\\n      rule seeks to preserve the integrity of a written agreement by\\n      barring the contracting parties from trying to alter the meaning of\\n      their agreement through use of contemporaneous oral\\n      declarations. Lenzi v. Hahnemann University, 445 Pa. Super.\\n      187, 664 A.2d 1375, 1379 (1995).\\n\\nId. at 589.\\n\\n      As reflected in the above-quoted excerpt from Yocca, our Supreme\\n\\nCourt has instructed that the terms and agreements reflected in a written\\n\\ncontract cannot be added to or subtracted from, absent fraud, accident, or\\n\\nmistake. Yocca, 854 A.2d at 436. “Once a writing is determined to be the\\n\\nparties’ entire contract, the parol evidence rule applies and evidence of any\\n\\nprevious oral or written negotiations or agreements involving the same subject\\n\\nmatter as the contract is almost always inadmissible to explain or vary the\\n\\nterms of the contract.”   Id. at 436-37 (citations omitted). More recently,\\n\\nhowever, the Court explained:\\n\\n      When parol evidence is admissible, “it must generally have a\\n      foundation in pre-existing evidence of fraud, accident or mistake,”\\n      except when it is introduced “not to contradict or vary, but to\\n      explain the contract, as when something is omitted . . . so as to\\n\\n                                    - 19 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n      qualify the tribunal passing upon the writing to interpret it truly\\n      according to the intent of the parties.”\\n\\nStarling v.

Brown,\\n\\n54 Pa. 77, 81–82 (1867)).\\n\\n      Similarly, in Lenzi, this Court held that “[t]he parol evidence rule does\\n\\nnot preclude the admission of evidence to establish whether the parties\\n\\nintended the writing to be a complete embodiment of their agreement.”\\n\\nLenzi, 664 A.2d at 1379 (citing Murray v. University of Pennsylvania\\n\\nHospital, 490 A.2d 839 (Pa. Super. 1985)) (emphasis in original). This Court\\n\\ndetermined that “whether the writing constituted the entire agreement was a\\n\\nquestion of law for the court,” and, therefore, the trial court properly allowed\\n\\ntestimony to determine whether the writing represented the entire contract.\\n\\nId. at 1379. “The trial court did not accept the introduction of parol evidence\\n\\nto vary the terms of the [document], but allowed the testimony to aid in\\n\\ndefining the intent of the parties with regard to termination of [Lenzi’s]\\n\\nemployment.”     Id. at 1379-80 (emphasis in original).        “Therefore, the\\n\\nintroduction of testimony as to intent was relevant to the ultimate issue as to\\n\\nwhether the [document] was a fully integrated writing and did not constitute\\n\\nerror.” Id. at 1380.

[Smith] had agreed to\\n      accept one-half of his shareholder loan claim from [the Company]\\n      to settle this issue. Likewise, [the Company, which] had argued\\n      it owed [Smith] nothing for any shareholder loan, agreed to pay\\n      [Smith] one-half of [Smith’s] claim to settle this issue.\\n\\nTrial Court Opinion, 3/10/20, at 6 (emphasis added). We find neither abuse\\n\\nof discretion nor error of law in its admission of the testimony. The testimony\\n\\nwas admissible to explain whether or not the Outline in fact resolved all issues\\n\\nbetween the parties, in particular, the settlement of Smith’s shareholder loan\\n\\naccount.      The record supports that paragraph 10 represented the final\\n\\nresolution of this last remaining issue. Accordingly, the court did not err in\\n\\nadmitting parol evidence and hence, determining that the Outline resolves the\\n\\nissue of Smith’s shareholder loan account. Smith is not entitled to relief on\\n\\nhis final two issues.\\n\\n\\n                                III. Conclusion\\n\\n      In sum, Smith’s procedural challenges to this specific performance case\\n\\nlack merit.     Additionally, the trial court’s factual finding that the parties\\n\\nentered into a written contract finds support in the evidence of record. We\\n\\nfurther conclude that the trial court did not err in relying upon parol evidence\\n\\nto ascertain that the parties intended the Outline to be a complete\\n\\n\\n                                      - 21 -\\n\fJ-A09027-21\\n\\n\\n\\nembodiment of their agreement.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\n                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\\n\\n\\n\\n EMPIRE HEALTH FOUNDATION, et al.,\\n\\n         Plaintiffs,\\n                v.                                      Civil Action No. 20-2149 (JEB)\\n\\n\\n XAVIER BECERRA, Secretary, U.S.\\n Department of Health and Human\\n Services,\\n\\n         Defendant.\\n\\n\\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\\n\\n       In this Medicare-reimbursement case, Plaintiffs Empire Health Foundation and hospitals\\n\\nit owns seek payment for certain services the hospitals provided to Medicare patients over a\\n\\ndecade ago. Following an administrative rollercoaster of reimbursement appeals and remands,\\n\\nDefendant Department of Health and Human Services dismissed the latest iteration of Plaintiffs’\\n\\nchallenge to the agency’s reimbursement formula. Unhappy with that decision, Plaintiffs\\n\\nbrought this suit, asking the Court to find the agency’s actions improper. After the completion of\\n\\nsummary-judgment briefing, Defendant now proposes an alternative: remand this case to allow\\n\\nthe agency to reevaluate Plaintiffs’ reimbursement sums in light of a forthcoming rule addressing\\n\\nthe question at the heart of their challenges. Although Plaintiffs oppose this outcome, the Court\\n\\nagrees with Defendant that this is the most efficient course; it will thus grant the Motion to\\n\\nRemand and return this case to the agency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 1\\n\fI.     Background\\n\\n       Empire Health Foundation and two hospitals it owns, Valley Hospital Medical Center\\n\\nand Deaconess Medical Center, seek reimbursement for services those hospitals provided to\\n\\nMedicare patients. Plaintiffs’ journey to obtain reimbursement has been long and winding, and\\n\\nthe Court provides a truncated version here. Interested readers may consult this Court’s earlier\\n\\nOpinion in Empire Health Foundation v. Burwell (Empire I), 209 F. Supp. 3d 261 (D.D.C.\\n\\n2016), for a more detailed account of the procedural history of this case and the Medicare\\n\\nreimbursement scheme it involves.\\n\\n       The gist of it is this: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\\n\\nadministers reimbursements for providers who treat Medicare patients. Id. at 263–64. Private\\n\\ncompanies enlisted by CMS (known as “Medicare Administrative Contractors” or “MACs”)\\n\\ncalculate the amount of reimbursement each provider is due through a complex equation that is\\n\\n“roughly pegged to the number of patients discharged.” Id. at 264 (emphasis omitted). They\\n\\ninform providers of their reimbursement sum in a document called a “Notice of Program\\n\\nReimbursement” (NPR). Id. Some NPRs include certain adjustments to the baseline formula.\\n\\nRelevant here, Valley and Deaconess received “‘disproportionate share hospital’ or ‘DSH’\\n\\nadjustment[s],” which are “a bump-up for hospitals that ‘serve[] a significantly disproportionate\\n\\nnumber of low-income patients.’” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(i)(I)). DSH\\n\\nadjustments are calculated by adding two fractions that determine the hospital’s disproportionate\\n\\npatient percentage for a fiscal period. See ECF No. 16-1 (Amended Complaint), ¶¶ 9–11. One\\n\\nof those fractions — the Medicare/SSI fraction — is at issue here. That fraction, which is\\n\\ncalculated by CMS, is determined by dividing the time spent caring for patients entitled to\\n\\nbenefits under both Medicare Part A and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program by\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                2\\n\fthe time spent caring for patients who are entitled to benefits under only Medicare Part A. Id.,\\n\\n¶¶ 10, 15; see also Azar v. Allina Health Services (Allina II), 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1809 (2019); 42\\n\\nU.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi)(I).\\n\\n       Providers that are unhappy with their reimbursement sum may appeal their NPR to the\\n\\nProvider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB), which is authorized to affirm or alter the\\n\\naward. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 16–18 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)). The PRRB’s determination\\n\\nis subject to further review by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Id., ¶ 18; see also\\n\\nEmpire I, 209 F. Supp. 3d at 264. Once the Secretary has issued her decision or declined to\\n\\nreview a decision of the PRRB, a provider has “the right to obtain judicial review.” Empire I,\\n\\n209 F. Supp. 3d at 264 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f)(1)); see also 42 C.F.R. § 405.1877.\\n\\n       Dissatisfied with the NPRs they received for the 2006 and 2007 years, respectively,\\n\\nValley Hospital and Deaconess Medical Center initiated this reimbursement-appeal process with\\n\\nthe PRRB in 2009. See Am. Compl., ¶ 19. Those appeals challenged the agency’s inclusion of\\n\\ntime spent treating Medicare Part C enrollees (Part-C days) in the Medicare/SSI fraction, which\\n\\nthe agency had done under the theory that Part-C patients are also entitled to benefits under Part\\n\\nA. Id. The PRRB remanded those appeals to the MACs, and Plaintiffs challenged that decision\\n\\nby filing suit in this Court. Id., ¶ 20. Finding that Plaintiffs’ challenges were premature because\\n\\nthe remand process had not yet been completed, this Court dismissed the case in September\\n\\n2016. Empire I, 209 F. Supp. 3d at 263.\\n\\n       When Plaintiffs received revised NPRs in March 2017, they again appealed to the PRRB,\\n\\nthis time also seeking expedited judicial review. See Am. Compl., ¶ 23. In their appeal, the\\n\\nproviders again challenged the treatment of Part-C days in the Medicare/SSI fraction. See ECF\\n\\nNo. 36 (Def. Reply) at 4. The PRRB held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the revised NPRs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 3\\n\fbecause the revisions had not included an adjustment to the Medicare/SSI fraction, and\\n\\nregulations prohibit consideration of any matter that has not been specifically revised. See Am.\\n\\nCompl., ¶ 24; ECF No. 16-6 (PRRB Decision in 17-0555GC) at 8–9; 42 C.F.R.\\n\\n§ 405.1889(b)(2). Plaintiffs filed another suit in this Court to vacate that decision and to order\\n\\nthe PRRB to reinstate its appeal from the initial NPRs. See Empire Health Foundation v. Azar\\n\\n(Empire II), No. 19-1692. Not long thereafter, the parties filed a Joint Motion to Remand the\\n\\ncase to the Secretary, and this Court granted the Motion and signed their Proposed Order in\\n\\nOctober 2019. See ECF No. 35-1 (Empire II Motion for Remand) at 7–8 (Empire II Remand\\n\\nOrder); see also No. 19-1692, Minute Order of Oct. 22, 2019; Am. Compl., ¶¶ 25–28. The\\n\\nPRRB has since reopened the case and issued a request for information to which the providers\\n\\nand the MAC have responded. See ECF Nos. 35-2 (MAC Response); 35-3 (Providers’\\n\\nResponse). No final decision has yet been rendered.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs’ challenge to the inclusion of Part-C days in the Medicare/SSI fraction was not\\n\\noriginal. That same challenge appeared in a congeries of suits, and the Supreme Court\\n\\nconfronted the issue in 2019. See Allina II, 139 S. Ct. at 1809–10. In Allina II, the Court held\\n\\nthat CMS could not implement a policy of including Part-C days in the Medicare/SSI fraction\\n\\nwithout going through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. Id. at 1817. It offered no\\n\\nview on the merits of whether Part-C days should be included in the fraction. The agency\\n\\nresponded to this decision in two ways: first, CMS issued a proposed rule stating that Part-C\\n\\ndays would be included in the Medicare/SSI fraction for fiscal years before 2013, and, second,\\n\\nCMS issued a ruling (CMS Ruling 1739-R) divesting the PRRB of jurisdiction over NPR appeals\\n\\nfrom before 2013 that raise the Part-C-days question until the issuance of the forthcoming final\\n\\nrule. See ECF No. 29 (Motion to Remand), ¶¶ 9–10; Medicare Program; Treatment of Medicare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 4\\n\fPart C Days in the Calculation of a Hospital’s Medicare Disproportionate Patient Percentage, 85\\n\\nFed. Reg. 47,723-01 (Aug. 6, 2020) (proposed rule); ECF No. 16-12 (CMS Ruling 1739-R). The\\n\\nSecretary also sought to consolidate ongoing lawsuits that raised the same issue, and 93 of them\\n\\n— including Deaconess’s 2007 appeal of its initial NPR — were consolidated before Judge Amy\\n\\nBerman Jackson. See In re: Allina II, Misc. No. 19‐190 (D.D.C.). Judge Jackson then remanded\\n\\nmany of these lawsuits — namely, all those that specifically challenged the inclusion of the Part-\\n\\nC days as improper because of the agency’s failure to undertake notice-and-comment\\n\\nrulemaking. Id., ECF No. 74 (Remand Order). Deaconess’s 2007 initial-NPR appeal was\\n\\namong those remanded. Id., ECF No. 74-1 (Appendix of Remanded Cases) at 3, item 79.\\n\\n       In the midst of this, Plaintiffs asked CMS to realign their Medicare/SSI fractions to the\\n\\nhospitals’ cost year (i.e., calendar-year reporting periods), rather than the federal fiscal years to\\n\\nwhich they had previously been aligned. See Am. Compl., ¶ 30. CMS granted this request, and\\n\\nPlaintiffs received adjusted NPRs on December 7, 2018. Id. Like those before them, these\\n\\nrealigned NPRs included Part-C days in the Medicare/SSI fraction. Id., ¶¶ 31–32. Plaintiffs thus\\n\\nappealed to the PRRB once more. Id., ¶¶ 32–33. Once more, the Board dismissed the appeal,\\n\\nfinding that “it [did] not have jurisdiction over the DSH Part C Days issue from the revised\\n\\nNPRs” because “the specific issue[] was not adjusted as part of the revised NPRs.” ECF No. 34-\\n\\n1 at ECF pp. 4–7 (PRRB Decision in Case No. 19-1983GC) at ECF p. 5. Although the realigned\\n\\nNPRs differed from those the providers had previously received, “CMS [did] not utilize a new or\\n\\ndifferent data match process when it issue[d] a realigned SSI percentage – all of the underlying\\n\\ndata remain[ed] the same, it is simply that a different time period [was] used.” Id. at ECF pp. 4–\\n\\n5 (emphasis in original). The same regulations that prohibited review of the revised\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   5\\n\fMedicare/SSI fractions in PRRB appeal No. 17-0555GC thus barred review in this case, No. 19-\\n\\n1983GC. See 42 C.F.R. § 405.1889(b)(2).\\n\\n       Unhappy with the PRRB’s dismissal of their appeal, Plaintiffs filed this action in August\\n\\nof 2020, see ECF No. 1 (Complaint), and their Amended Complaint that December. Plaintiffs\\n\\nallege four counts: 1) the PRRB’s Decision in Case No. 19-1983GC violated this Court’s remand\\n\\nOrder in Empire II; 2) the PRRB has unreasonably delayed resolving Plaintiffs’ appeals, in\\n\\nviolation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(1); 3) the PRRB incorrectly held that it lacked jurisdiction over the\\n\\nappeal of Plaintiffs’ realigned NPRs in Case No. 19-1983GC; and 4) CMS Ruling 1739-R is\\n\\ninvalid. See Am. Compl., ¶¶ 37–54. Waiting for some reason until after both sides had\\n\\ncompleted dispositive briefing, Defendant filed a Motion for a voluntary remand of this case to\\n\\nthe Secretary on November 19, 2021. See ECF No. 29 (Motion to Remand). Plaintiffs opposed,\\n\\nsee ECF No. 35 (Pl. Opp.), asking the Court to retain the case and decide the summary-judgment\\n\\ndispute.\\n\\nII.    Legal Standard\\n\\n       Courts have “broad discretion to grant or deny an agency’s motion to remand.” Utility\\n\\nSolid Waste Activities Group v. EPA, 901 F.3d 414, 436 (D.C. Cir. 2018); see also Code v.\\n\\nMcHugh, 139 F. Supp. 3d 465, 468 (D.D.C. 2015) (“The decision whether to grant an agency’s\\n\\nrequest to remand is left to the discretion of the court.”). That said, courts will “generally grant\\n\\nan agency’s motion . . . so long as ‘the agency intends to take further action with respect to the\\n\\noriginal agency decision on review.’” Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, 901 F.3d at 436\\n\\n(quoting Limnia, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Energy, 857 F.3d 379, 386 (D.C. Cir. 2017)). The\\n\\nrationale for this approach is clear: courts “prefer[] to allow agencies to cure their own mistakes\\n\\nrather than wast[e] the courts’ and the parties’ resources reviewing a record that both sides\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  6\\n\facknowledge to be incorrect or incomplete.” Ethyl Corp. v. Browner, 989 F.2d 522, 524 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 1993); accord FBME Bank Ltd. v Lew, 142 F. Supp. 3d 70, 73 (D.D.C. 2015). For this\\n\\nreason, “[v]oluntary remand is typically appropriate (i) when new evidence becomes available\\n\\nafter an agency’s original decision was rendered, or (ii) where intervening events outside of the\\n\\nagency’s control may affect the validity of an agency’s actions.” FBME Bank Ltd., 142 F. Supp.\\n\\n3d at 73 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n        These are not the only circumstances, however, in which a voluntary remand is\\n\\nwarranted. “Even in the absence of new evidence or an intervening event, . . . courts retain the\\n\\ndiscretion to remand an agency decision when an agency has raised ‘substantial and legitimate’\\n\\nconcerns in support of remand.” Id. (quoting Carpenters Industrial Council v. Salazar, 734 F.\\n\\nSupp. 2d 126, 132 (D.D.C. 2010)). Two factors constrain this discretion. First, the Court will\\n\\nnot grant an agency request that “appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith.” Utility Solid\\n\\nWaste Activities Group, 901 F.3d at 436. Second, courts should “consider whether remand\\n\\nwould unduly prejudice the non-moving party.” Id.; see also FBME Bank Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 3d\\n\\nat 73 (similar).\\n\\nIII.    Analysis\\n\\n        The Secretary moves for a voluntary remand to allow him to re-examine Plaintiffs’\\n\\nappeals in light of Allina II and its aftermath. See Mot. to Remand at 1. All of Plaintiffs’\\n\\nchallenges, HHS asserts, are aimed at obtaining an answer to whether Part-C days are properly\\n\\nincluded in the Medicare/SSI fraction, and so remand is the most efficient way forward. Id.,\\n\\n¶¶ 1, 13–14; see also Def. Repl. at 3–4. Plaintiffs mount a litany of protests to such a remand\\n\\nand alternatively ask the Court to retain jurisdiction over this case should it decide a remand is\\n\\nappropriate. See Pl. Opp. at 1–25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 7\\n\f          As a preliminary matter, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the standards\\n\\napplicable to modifying an order — rather than those applicable to a motion for remand —\\n\\nshould govern this case. See Pl. Opp. at 1–5; ECF No. 37-1 (Pl. Surreply) at 4–7. Their\\n\\nargument is based on their belief that a remand here would “significant[ly] alter[]” the remand\\n\\nOrder this Court approved in Empire II. See Pl. Opp. at 3. That belief is mistaken. The Order in\\n\\nEmpire II remanded the Part-C claims that “were raised in Provider Reimbursement Review\\n\\nBoard (‘PRRB’) group appeal number 17-0555GC.” Case No. 19-1692, ECF No. 12-1 (Empire\\n\\nII Remand Order). As discussed earlier, that appeal involved Plaintiffs’ revised NPRs that were\\n\\naligned to federal fiscal years, not the NPRs that had been realigned to the hospitals’ cost years.\\n\\nIt also predated the PRRB decision on appeal here: appeal number 19-1983GC. Id., Minute\\n\\nOrder of October 22, 2019 (granting Empire II motion to remand); PRRB Decision in Case No.\\n\\n19-1983GC (June 10, 2020). The Empire II remand Order thus does not govern the appeal\\n\\npresently before the Court, and so a remand here would not modify it.\\n\\n          Under the standards that govern motions to remand, this Court has “broad discretion to\\n\\ngrant or deny an agency’s motion.” Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, 901 F.3d at 436. The\\n\\nagency has explained that it seeks a remand in order to reconsider the Medicare/SSI fractions in\\n\\nlight of the forthcoming rule regarding Part-C days — a path it believes will prevent it from\\n\\nmaking the same mistake that led to reversal in Allina II. See Def. Repl. at 3, 5–6. Even if the\\n\\nAllina II decision does not govern this case and require a remand, as Plaintiffs contend, see Pl.\\n\\nOpp. at 5–9, this seems a prudent path, since any decision of the PRRB on remand following a\\n\\ndisposition of this case in Plaintiffs’ favor would still be subject to review of the Secretary, who\\n\\npresumably would follow the methodology established in the forthcoming Rule. See Def. Repl.\\n\\nat 5–6.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                   8\\n\f       The Court is persuaded, furthermore, that a remand will “preserve[] scarce judicial\\n\\nresources by allowing [the] agenc[y] ‘to cure [its] own mistakes.’” Carpenters Industrial\\n\\nCouncil, 734 F. Supp. 2d at 132 (granting voluntary remand where change in law rendered\\n\\nprevious agency decision suspect). Plaintiffs object that the Court cannot properly remand this\\n\\ncase because the question of whether Part-C days are CORRECTLY included in the\\n\\nMedicare/SSI fraction is not before it. See Pl. Opp. at 12–15. While it is true that none of\\n\\nPlaintiffs’ claims directly asks this Court to address the Part-C question, the claims all\\n\\n“redound[] to [an] administrative challenge[] that their DSH adjustments were too low because\\n\\nthe Secretary wrongly interpreted the DSH statute by including Part C patient days in the\\n\\nMedicare/SSI fraction.” Def. Repl. at 3–4. In other words, each of Plaintiffs’ procedural\\n\\nchallenges is merely an attempt to expedite a recalculation of their realigned NPRs that omits the\\n\\nPart-C days from the Medicare/SSI fraction. The agency’s request to reevaluate the treatment of\\n\\nthese Part-C days thus indicates an “intention to reconsider, re-review, or modify the original\\n\\nagency decision that is the subject of the legal challenge,” Limnia, 857 F.3d at 387, even if the\\n\\nPart-C question was not directly raised before this Court. Defendants have, therefore, “raised\\n\\n‘substantial and legitimate’ concerns in support of remand.” Carpenters Industrial Council, 734\\n\\nF. Supp. 2d at 132 (quoting Sierra Club v. Antwerp, 560 F. Supp. 2d 21, 23 (D.D.C. 2008)).\\n\\n       Remand is appropriate, then, unless “the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or\\n\\nmade in bad faith” or “remand would unduly prejudice the non-moving party.” Utility Solid\\n\\nWaste Activities Group, 901 F.3d at 436 (citing FBME Bank Ltd., 142 F. Supp. 3d at 73, and\\n\\nSKF USA Inc. v. United States, 254 F.3d 1022, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). As to the first condition,\\n\\nthe Court finds no evidence of bad faith or frivolity. To the extent that Plaintiffs accuse\\n\\nDefendant’s remand Motion of being pretext for dismissing this case, see Pl. Opp. at 10–12, the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                  9\\n\fCourt is not convinced. Contrary to their suggestion, HHS nowhere requests a dismissal, and\\n\\nthis scenario bears little resemblance to the one in Limnia, where remand would have left the\\n\\nPlaintiffs with only the option of restarting their agency challenge from the beginning. See 857\\n\\nF.3d at 387–88 (remand request was impermissible attempt to dismiss case where agency\\n\\nrequested remand not to reconsider license application but to review any new application\\n\\nplaintiff submitted). Likewise, the Court has no reason to think this remand is frivolous, as the\\n\\nSecretary has stated his intention to “reconsider” the question at the heart of Plaintiffs’\\n\\nchallenges. See Motion to Remand at 7.\\n\\n        Nor would this remand cause Plaintiffs undue prejudice. See Utility Solid Waste\\n\\nActivities Group, 901 F.3d at 436. In fact, as Defendant points out, “Granting the Secretary a\\n\\nvoluntary remand will merely put Plaintiffs in the materially same position as if the Court were\\n\\nto grant them summary judgment” since the relief to which they would be entitled if successful\\n\\non each of their claims is a remand to the agency. See Def. Repl. at 1; Banner Heart Hospital v.\\n\\nBurwell, 201 F. Supp. 3d 131, 143 (D.D.C. 2016) (finding remand was only appropriate remedy\\n\\nafter setting aside agency action). Plaintiffs may be correct that resolution will not come anytime\\n\\nsoon, but they face a potentially lengthy administrative process whether their claims are returned\\n\\nto the agency now or at the end of litigation in this Court. See Clark v. Perdue, No. 19-394, 2019\\n\\nWL 2476614, at * 3 (D.D.C. June 13, 2019) (finding remand proper where it was same relief to\\n\\nwhich plaintiff would have been entitled after merits resolution despite plaintiff’s objection that\\n\\nremand would delay resolution). Faster resolution might be had if this Court were to conclude\\n\\nthat Defendant was entitled to judgment on the merits, but that is surely not a preferable outcome\\n\\nfor Plaintiffs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                 10\\n\f       They also argue that, in addition to delaying resolution of their claims, remand will\\n\\nprejudice them by creating “jurisdictional uncertainties as to whether and how Plaintiffs will be\\n\\nable to obtain administrative and judicial review of their claims after the remand is completed.”\\n\\nPl. Opp. at 18–19. Defendants have clarified, however, that the agency’s reopening regulations\\n\\n— which led to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of the prior PRRB appeals — would not\\n\\napply to these claims on remand. See Def. Repl. at 8–10. Rather, “[t]he DSH payment\\n\\nadjustments for Part C patient days that will be calculated under the forthcoming rule will be new\\n\\ndeterminations with statutory appeal rights,” even if the NPRs are not changed. Id. at 10 (citing\\n\\n42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a)(3), (f)). The prejudice Plaintiffs fear, then, will not come to pass.\\n\\n       The Court therefore concludes that remand is appropriate. See American Wild Horse\\n\\nPreservation Campaign v. Salazar, 115 F. Supp. 3d 1, 2 (D.D.C. 2012) (“[A]n agency’s motion\\n\\nto remand for reconsideration of its own decision is usually granted.”) (citation omitted).\\n\\n                                         *       *       *\\n\\n       Before returning this appeal to the agency, the Court last addresses Plaintiffs’ request that\\n\\nit retain jurisdiction and “‘an active supervisory role’ during the period of remand.” Pl. Opp. at\\n\\n24–25 (citing Clark, 2019 WL 2476614, at *4). The Court “has the discretion to retain\\n\\njurisdiction over a case pending completion of a remand,” but exercise of that discretion is\\n\\n“typically reserved for cases alleging unreasonable delay of agency action or failure to comply\\n\\nwith a statutory deadline, or for cases involving a history of agency noncompliance with court\\n\\norders or resistance to the fulfillment of legal duties.” Baystate Medical Center v. Leavitt, 587 F.\\n\\nSupp. 2d 37, 41 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).\\n\\nAlthough this case does involve a claim of unreasonable delay, the Court does not find that it\\n\\nconstitutes one of the rare cases in which deviation from the “norm [] to vacate agency action . . .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                11\\n\fand remand for further proceedings consistent with the judicial decision, without retaining\\n\\noversight over the remand proceedings” is warranted. Id. In particular, the Court notes that\\n\\nthere is no evidence of noncompliance with court orders or attempts to avoid legal duties, and so\\n\\nthe agency is entitled to the presumption that it will discharge its duties in good faith. See CTIA-\\n\\nThe Wireless Association v. FCC, 530 F.3d 984, 989 (D.C. Cir. 2008); see also Baystate Medical\\n\\nCenter, 587 F. Supp. 2d at 41 n.5 (“The Court does not consider the years-long administrative\\n\\nlitigation before the Provider Reimbursement Review Board and the CMS Administrator to\\n\\nindicate recalcitrance and resistance to fulfilling legal duties, but instead to reflect the kind of\\n\\nhard-fought litigation that regularly occurs in cases involving programmatic relief and multi-\\n\\nmillion dollar payments.”). This Court, accordingly, will not retain jurisdiction over this case on\\n\\nremand.\\n\\nIV.     Conclusion\\n\\n        For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion for Remand will be granted.

Fox, for\\nappellee.\\n\\n\\nBefore FERNANDEZ, C.J., and SCALES and GORDO, JJ.\\n\\n     SCALES, J.\\n\f      Max Tafel Selman (“Insured”), the plaintiff below, appeals from a July\\n\\n22, 2020 order granting Progressive American Insurance Company’s\\n\\n(“Progressive”) post-judgment motion that Progressive labeled its “Motion to\\n\\nEnforce Settlement and Compliance with the Court’s March 20, 2020 Order”\\n\\n(“Progressive’s Motion”). The trial court entered the challenged order having\\n\\npreviously entered a March 20, 2020 final judgment that had reserved\\n\\njurisdiction to further enforce the terms of the parties’ settlement agreement.\\n\\nWe reverse because, by adjudicating Progressive’s Motion and entering the\\n\\nchallenged order, the trial court exceeded the limited continuing jurisdiction\\n\\nthe trial court had reserved in its final judgment.\\n\\n      I.    BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\\n\\n       In November 2018, Insured was involved in an automobile accident\\n\\nthat totaled his vehicle that was insured by Progressive. While Progressive\\n\\nagreed that the loss was covered under its policy and that there was a total\\n\\nloss, the parties disagreed as to the value of the loss.\\n\\n      On December 21, 2018, Insured filed this first party insurance action\\n\\nagainst Progressive in the Miami-Dade County county court, seeking policy\\n\\nbenefits for the covered loss. A year later, at a subsequent court-ordered\\n\\nappraisal, the parties reached a settlement agreement wherein the parties\\n\\nagreed only that the actual cash value of Insured’s vehicle was $10,834\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       2\\n\f“[b]efore, [t]ax, title, deductible or any statutory or contractual fees” and that\\n\\n“[t]his claim is hereby settled and closed.” These terms are reflected in a one-\\n\\npage agreement, dated December 18, 2019, executed by the parties’\\n\\nrespective counsel.\\n\\n      On January 21, 2020, Insured filed in the county court action a motion\\n\\nto enforce the parties’ December 18, 2019 settlement agreement.\\n\\nProgressive did not file a response. On March 11, 2020, the trial court held\\n\\na hearing on Insured’s motion, but the record contains no hearing transcript.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2020, the trial court entered its final judgment that granted\\n\\nInsured’s motion to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement. Therein, the\\n\\ntrial court ordered only that Progressive pay Insured the agreed $10,834\\n\\nsettlement amount plus $181.65 in statutory interest. The final paragraph of\\n\\nthe final judgment states:\\n\\n             The Court further finds that the judicial labor in this matter\\n      is complete for which this Court issues this Final Judgment\\n      closing the case. [Progressive] shall pay [Insured] in accordance\\n      with the settlement agreement and this order. The Court reserves\\n      jurisdiction to determine entitlement to, and amount of, attorney\\n      fees and costs in this matter and to enforce the terms of this\\n      Order and the settlement agreement.\\n\\n      Following the trial court’s entry of the final judgment, Progressive\\n\\nneither filed a Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530 motion for rehearing of\\n\\nthe final judgment nor sought to appeal the final judgment. Instead,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        3\\n\fProgressive complied with the final judgment and, pursuant to the final\\n\\njudgment, issued payment to Insured.\\n\\n        Forty-one days after the final judgment was rendered and twenty days\\n\\nafter making payment to Insured pursuant to the final judgment, Progressive\\n\\nfiled Progressive’s Motion. In Progressive’s Motion, Progressive informed\\n\\nthe trial court, for the first time, that on February 25, 2020 – two weeks prior\\n\\nto the hearing on Insured’s motion to enforce the parties’ settlement\\n\\nagreement and about a month prior to the entry of the final judgment –\\n\\nProgressive had paid $10,031.17 to the lienholder of Insured’s vehicle. 1\\n\\nProgressive’s Motion argued, that, in light of Progressive’s February 25,\\n\\n2020 payment to Insured’s lienholder, Progressive’s payment to Insured\\n\\npursuant to the final judgment resulted in a windfall for Insured, and the trial\\n\\ncourt should order Insured to repay Progressive.\\n\\n        Following a hearing on Progressive’s Motion, on July 22, 2020, the trial\\n\\ncourt entered the challenged order requiring Insured to repay $10,031.17 of\\n\\nthe $10,834 amount that Progressive had paid to Insured pursuant to the\\n\\nfinal judgment. After the lower court denied Insured’s motion for rehearing,\\n\\nInsured timely appealed the challenged order.\\n\\n        II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\n\\n1\\n    The $10,031.17 figure satisfied the lien on Insured’s vehicle.\\n\\n                                        4\\n\f      “A settlement agreement is contractual in nature and therefore\\n\\ninterpreted and governed by contract law. We therefore review de novo the\\n\\ntrial court’s order interpreting the Settlement Agreement.” Platinum Luxury\\n\\nAuctions, LLC v. Concierge Auctions, LLC, 227 So. 3d 685, 688 (Fla. 3d\\n\\nDCA 2017) (citation omitted). The extent to which a trial court has reserved\\n\\njurisdiction in a final judgment is also a pure question of law that we review\\n\\nde novo. See Cent. Mortg. Co. v. Callahan, 155 So. 3d 373, 375 n.2 (Fla. 3d\\n\\nDCA 2014).\\n\\n      III.   ANALYSIS\\n\\n      While Insured makes several arguments on appeal, we address the\\n\\ndispositive argument of whether the trial court, in its final judgment, retained\\n\\nthe jurisdiction to adjudicate Progressive’s Motion and grant the relief\\n\\ncontained in the challenged order. “When a trial court approves a settlement\\n\\nagreement and retains jurisdiction to enforce its terms, the trial court has the\\n\\njurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.” Platinum\\n\\nLuxury Auctions, LLC, 227 So. 3d at 688. “[T]he extent of the court’s\\n\\ncontinuing jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement is\\n\\ncircumscribed by the terms of that agreement.” Id. (quoting Paulucci v. Gen.\\n\\nDynamics Corp., 842 So. 2d 797, 803 (Fla. 2003)). Where the trial court\\n\\ngrants relief beyond the terms of the settlement agreement, the court\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       5\\n\fexceeds the jurisdiction the court reserved for itself. Id.; see also Ross v.\\n\\nWells Fargo Bank, 114 So. 3d 256, 257 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013) (concluding that\\n\\na trial court acts without authority by awarding post-judgment relief not\\n\\ncontemplated by the final judgment).\\n\\n      Without question, by entering the challenged order, the trial court was\\n\\ntrying to accomplish equity. Nonetheless, despite such good intentions,\\n\\ngiven the facts of this case, we are compelled to conclude that the trial court\\n\\nexceeded its jurisdiction by awarding post-judgment relief that was beyond\\n\\nthe terms of the parties’ settlement agreement and not contemplated by the\\n\\nfinal judgment. Nothing in the settlement agreement addressed, nor did\\n\\nanything in the final judgment contemplate, Progressive’s unliteral payment\\n\\nto the lienholder, much less Insured reimbursing Progressive for this\\n\\npayment.\\n\\n      Indeed, the settlement agreement did not include any mention of a\\n\\npayment to a lienholder, and the final judgment could not have contemplated\\n\\na requirement for Insured to repay Progressive for such payment because\\n\\nthe trial court was not informed that Progressive had made its lienholder\\n\\npayment until forty-one days after the final judgment was rendered. Hence,\\n\\nirrespective of how it may have been captioned, Progressive’s Motion did not\\n\\nseek an adjudication related to the enforcement of the parties’ settlement\\n\\n\\n\\n                                       6\\n\fagreement or any provision of the final judgment. Simply put, Progressive’s\\n\\nMotion sought to vacate the final judgment and, by the time Progressive’s\\n\\nMotion was filed, the trial court had lost jurisdiction to revisit its final\\n\\njudgment. See Herskowitz v. Herskowitz, 513 So. 2d 1318, 1319 (Fla. 3d\\n\\nDCA 1987) (“[O]nce a judgment becomes final – as where (a) a final\\n\\njudgment has been entered, and (b) a motion for rehearing under 1.530 has\\n\\nbeen denied or no such motion is filed and the [time] for filing same has\\n\\nexpired – the trial court loses jurisdiction to rehear the judgment on the\\n\\nmerits.”). The limited jurisdiction reserved in the final judgment did not\\n\\ninclude adjudicating, and granting relief upon, the issue raised in\\n\\nProgressive’s Motion.\\n\\n      To interpret the final judgment’s reservation of jurisdiction provision\\n\\notherwise would not only be contrary to the terms of the parties’ settlement\\n\\nagreement and the language of the final judgment, but it would undermine\\n\\nboth the finality of judgments and the purpose for including such reservation\\n\\nof jurisdiction provisions in judgments. 2 Accordingly, we find that the trial\\n\\n\\n2\\n   To the extent Progressive claims that the parties’ written settlement\\nagreement did not constitute the full agreement in light of events that\\ntranspired subsequent to its execution by the parties’ respective counsel,\\nProgressive should have timely moved for rehearing of the final judgment in\\nthe lower court and, if necessary, appealed from the final judgment.\\nProgressive did neither.\\n\\n\\n                                      7\\n\fcourt’s July 22, 2020 order requiring Insured to repay Progressive exceeded\\n\\nthe jurisdiction the trial court reserved for itself in the final judgment. We,\\n\\ntherefore, reverse the challenged order and remand for further proceedings\\n\\nconsistent with this opinion. 3\\n\\n      Reversed and remanded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Expressing no opinion on the merits of any such motion or claim, we note\\nthat our decision is without prejudice to Progressive timely filing a Florida\\nRule of Civil Procedure 1.540 motion below or pursuing a separate\\nrecoupment action against Insured.\\n\\n                                      8\\n\f\n",

Because no briefs\\nhave been filed, this matter stands submitted for decision based on the\\nrecord. SCR 105(3)(b).\\n            The State I3ar has the burden of showing by clear and\\nconvincing evidence that Michaelides committed the violations charged. In\\nre Discipline of Drakulich, 111 Nev. 1556, 1566, 908 P.2d 709, 715 (1995).\\nWe defer to the panel's factual findings that Michaelides violated the above-\\nreferenced rules as those findings are supported by substantial evidence\\nand are not clearly erroneous. SCR 105(3)(b); In re Discipline of Colin, 135\\nNev. 325, 330, 448 P.3d 556, 560 (2019). In particular, the record shows\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                 c102 -05453\\n\f                   that one of Michaelides non-attorney employees sent a falsified default\\n                   judgment order directly to a represented opposing party, as well as to\\n                   another party, in an attempt to coerce the removal of a negative internet\\n                   review about Michaelides. The record further shows that Michaelides had\\n                   the opportunity to explain the situation to the district court but failed to do\\n                   so. This evidence supports the complaint's allegations concerning\\n                   Michaelides' professional misconduct. SCR 105(2).\\n                               Turning to the appropriate discipline, we review the hearing\\n                   panel's recommendation de novo.            SCR 105(3)(b). Although we\\n                   \"must . . . exercise independent judgment,\" the panel's recommendation is\\n                   persuasive. In re Discipline of Schaefer, 117 Nev. 496, 515, 25 P.3d 191, 204\\n                   (2001). In determining the appropriate discipline, we weigh four factors:\\n                   \"the duty violated, the lawyer's mental state, the potential or actual injury\\n                   caused by the lawyer's misconduct, and the existence of aggravating or\\n                   mitigating factors.\" In re Discipline of Lerner, 124 Nev. 1232, 1246, 197\\n                   P.3d 1067, 1077 (2008).\\n                               Here, Michaelides violated duties owed to the legal system\\n                   (candor to the tribunal, fairness to opposing party and counsel, truthfulness\\n                   in statements to others, conamunications with represented persons, and\\n                   misconduct) and duties owed as a professional (responsibilities regarding\\n                   nonlawyer assistants). His mental state was intentional or knowing as to\\n                   the candor to the tribunal and responsibilities regarding nonlawyer\\n                   assistant violations, and negligent as to the remaining violations. And\\n                   while Michaelides ultimately stipulated to set aside the falsified default\\n                   judgment order, the opposing party was injured as he incurred attorney fees\\n                   to challenge that order. Creating a falsified judgment also caused actual\\n                   injury to the legal profession and system.\\n\\nSUPREME COURT\\n      OF\\n    NEVADA\\n                                                         2\\nOA 1947A clafica\\n\f             The baseline sanction for Michaelides misconduct, before\\nconsidering aggravating and mitigating circumstances, is suspension. See\\nStandards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, Compendium of Professional\\nResponsibility Rules and Standards, Standard 6.12 (Am. Bar Asen 2018)\\n(providing that suspension is appropriate when \"a lawyer knows that\\nfalse . . . documents are being submitted to the court or that material\\ninformation is improperly being withheld, and takes no remedial action, and\\ncauses injury or potential injury to a party to the legal proceeding, or causes\\nan adverse or potentially adverse effect on the legal proceedine), Standard\\n6.32 (providing that suspension is generally appropriate \"when a lawyer\\nengages in communication with an individual in the legal system when the\\nlawyer knows that such communication is improper, and causes injury or\\npotential injury to a party or causes interference or potential interference\\nwith the outcome of the legal proceedine), Standard 7.2 (providing that\\nsuspension is appropriate \"when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct\\nthat is a violation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or\\npotential injury to a client, the public, or the legal system\"). The record\\nsupports five aggravating circumstances (prior disciplinary offenses,\\ndishonest or selfish motive, pattern of misconduct, multiple offenses, and\\nsubstantial experience in the practice of law) and one mitigating\\ncircumstance (a certain amount of remorse) found by the panel.'\\n\\n\\n\\n      1The  panel also found, in mitigation, that Michaelides was subject to\\nother sanctions and penalties, referring to the approximately $51,000 of\\nattorney fees awarded to the opposing party in the falsified judgment case.\\nWe do not consider this as a mitigating circumstance, however, as the\\ndistrict court awarded the attorney fees because Michaelides' claims were\\nmeritless under Nevada's anti-SLAPP statutes rather than because of the\\nconduct we address in this disciplinary action.\\n\\n\\n                                      3\\n\f                     Considering all the factors, we agree that the panel's proposed discipline is\\n                     appropriate to serve the purpose of attorney discipline.

As conditions on his\\n                     probation, Michaelides shall (1) obtain a legal practice mentor approved by\\n                     the State Bar and provide quarterly reports to the State Bar and (2) engage\\n                     in no professional misconduct following the date of this order that results in\\n                     a screening panel recommending that new disciplinary charges be filed\\n                     against Michaelides.

      "0     [MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN 3 interest. The Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (“O&C Act”) addresses the use of timberlands in the southwest corner of Oregon., 6 MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN OPINION McKEOWN, Circuit Judge: This case calls on us to consider the intersection of the Antiquities Act, adopted in 1906, and the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (“O&C Act”), adopted in 1937., Because we conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear Murphy’s challenge, we next evaluate whether the Proclamation’s restriction on logging is consistent with the O&C Act., We affirm the district 8 MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States and Soda Mountain., In 1866, the United States made a grant of purportedly “public lands” to private railroad companies to facilitate the construction of a rail line between Oregon and California., 10, 1869, ch. 27, 16 Stat. 47. But the railroads violated the terms of the grant and, by 1893, had failed to dispose of the vast majority of the parcels., L. No. 86, ch. 137, 39 Stat. 218, 220. But the 1916 Act was “more a triumph of expediency than a statesmanlike solution,” and its convoluted timber-for-taxes funding scheme left many Oregon counties in “dire financial straits.” David Maldwyn Ellis, The Oregon and California Railroad Land Grant, 1866-1945, 39 Pac., at 487. The statute reads, in part: [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, which have heretofore or may hereafter be classified as timberlands, and power-site lands valuable for timber, shall be managed ., After reviewing the O&C Act’s plain text and legislative history, we hold that the Proclamation is a valid exercise of the President’s Antiquities Act authority., The opening paragraph of the O&C Act reveals the breadth of congressional purpose: [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, which have heretofore or may hereafter be classified as MURPHY CO., We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States and Soda Mountain., However, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusion that Proclamation 9564 does not conflict with the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (O&C Act)., We should hold that “[t]he President cannot authorize a secretary ., Although the Antiquities Act does grant the President broad authority to establish national monuments, nowhere does it remotely purport to grant him authority to suspend the operation of another act of Congress., An executive proclamation issued pursuant to a general grant of authority cannot supersede a specific act of Congress., . . . To deny this, would be to affirm . . . that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves ., “Congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act.” Dames & Moore v., v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600 (1983). And “[u]nder the Youngstown tripartite framework, congressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President’s action falls within the second category—that is, when he ‘acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority.’” Medellin v., Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991). Moreover, even an affirmative act of Congress cannot grant the President the power to indefinitely modify or nullify duly enacted law., I can find no limiting principle within the majority opinion that counsels otherwise., I think it manifestly more sensible to apply a different presumption: I would not construe a statute to grant the President unfettered authority to indefinitely suspend or cancel the operation of federal law, see id., IV Notwithstanding the undeniable conflict between Proclamation 9564 and the O&C Act, the majority concludes they can be reconciled because the O&C Act “delegated ample discretion to the Department of the Interior to manage the lands in a flexible manner.” But it is unclear how the mere grant of discretion as to how a sustained yield analysis should be conducted can justify the President’s total prohibition on even engaging in a sustained yield analysis in MURPHY CO., United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019). Given the O&C Act incorporated O&C lands “heretofore” and “hereafter” classified as timberlands, rather than grant the Secretary unbounded discretion, it seems more likely that Congress intended for the Secretary to classify O&C land consistent with past practice, meaning “lands bearing a growth of timber not less than three hundred thousand” board feet per 40 acres.]\n",

Factual For the purposes of resolving CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court assumes the facts alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint to be true and construes them in Ms., See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 1, 153-68. B. Procedural On March 5, 2018, CNA filed this Motion to Dismiss Ms., &amp; Opp’n Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Counts V &amp; VI Fourth Am., in Further Supp. Mot.

Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal of an action for “lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” Fed., R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that the Court has subject matter 6 jurisdiction over the case., of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182–83, (1936)). “Because Rule 12(b)(1) concerns a court’s ability to hear a particular claim, the court must scrutinize the [party]’s allegations more closely when considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) than it would under a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Schmidt v., 1992). C. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint., Despite this liberal pleading standard, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S., “[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss [pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)], a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.” Atherton v., Circuit “did not remand the case with directions to allow amending the complaint to include Pool’s individual claims.” Def.’s Objs., ECF No., Pool’s Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss and not any allegations in the FAC., Pool filed with her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss., Although a court may not 16 consider new allegations raised in response to a motion to dismiss, see Briscoe, 61 F., 255 at 9; her objection merely repeats her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare Pl.’s Objs., ECF No., Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 227 at 15-19. Accordingly, the Court reviews this objection only for clear error, see Houlahan, 979 F., See Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 12-15. As with her repudiation argument, see supra, her objection largely restates her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare id., with Pl.’s Opp’n &amp; Resp., Def. CNA’s Mot.

THE LOWER COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN FAILING TO HOLD THAT PUBLIC POLICY DEMANDS THAT PLAINTIFF BE PROTECTED FROM FURTHER ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY DEFENDANT., As we noted, the trial judge stated she \"did not find [plaintiff's] testimony to be credible or convincing.\" This fleeting reference did not signal the judge had elevated plaintiff's burden of proof because in the following paragraph of the trial judge's decision she concluded plaintiff had not met the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence., The judge relied on more than plaintiff's delay to conclude the filing was motivated by considerations other than domestic violence.]\n",

So, when was Arnold \"injured,\" such that it could successfully sue to establish its rights in the Marmaton formation? We conclude that no injury occurred to Arnold before July 2012, when it first requested payment of its overriding royalty interest., We hold that Arnold brought a timely lawsuit in 2012 to enforce its valid overriding royalty interest in the Marmaton formation under the oil-and-gas leases executed in 1973.]\n",
