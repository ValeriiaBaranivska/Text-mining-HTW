It has\\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    3\\n\\n\\ninterest. The Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay\\nWagon Road Grant Lands Act (“O&C Act”) addresses the\\nuse of timberlands in the southwest corner of Oregon.\\n    Murphy, an Oregon timber business, sought declaratory\\nand injunctive relief, and claimed that the Proclamation was\\nan invalid exercise of the Antiquities Act because it offended\\nthe O&C Act’s promise to reserve certain lands for timber\\nproduction. A collection of environmental organizations\\nintervened to defend the Proclamation.\\n     The panel first considered whether Murphy’s claim of\\nultra vires and unconstitutional action with respect to the\\nProclamation was immune from judicial review. In the\\nabsence of a statutory waiver, the Supreme Court has\\npermitted judicial review of presidential actions in two\\ncircumstances. First, the Court has recognized constitutional\\nchallenges to presidential acts as reviewable. Second, the\\nCourt has held that actions by subordinate Executive Branch\\nofficials that extend beyond delegated statutory authority—\\ni.e., ultra vires actions—are reviewable.             Whether\\ncharacterized as ultra vires or constitutional, the panel held\\nthat Murphy’s claims against the President regarding\\nProclamation 9564 were justiciable. Here, the core of\\nMurphy’s claim—that the President violated separation of\\npowers by directing the Secretary of Interior to act in\\ncontravention of a duly enacted law—could be considered\\nconstitutional and therefore reviewable. The panel\\nconcluded that Murphy’s particularized allegations that the\\nO&C Act restricts the President’s designation powers under\\nthe Antiquities Act satisfied the applicable jurisdictional\\nstandard.\\n    Next, the panel evaluated whether the Proclamation’s\\nrestriction on logging was consistent with the O&C\\n\f4                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nAct. Murphy alleged that the O&C Act’s directive of\\n“permanent forest production” circumscribed the scope of\\npresidential authority over these specific lands. First, the\\npanel held that the O&C Act did not explicitly or impliedly\\nrepeal the Antiquities Act. Nothing supports a claim that the\\nAntiquities Act proclamations are broadsides at land-\\nmanagement laws and cannot coexist with preexisting\\ncongressional mandates. The panel held that there was no\\nbasis to suggest that Congress intended the O&C Act to\\nnullify the Antiquities Act—which was itself an act of\\nCongress. Second, the panel held that the Proclamation’s\\nexercise of Antiquities Act power was consistent with the\\ntext, history, and purpose of the O&C Act. Timber\\nproduction was not the sole purpose that Congress\\nenvisioned for the more than two million acres of O&C\\nlands. Congress delegated ample discretion to the\\nDepartment of the Interior to manage the lands in a flexible\\nmanner. Third, the panel held that the dissent’s concerns\\nthat the Proclamation and the O&C Act are in conflict are\\nunsubstantiated. The panel concluded that the Proclamation\\nwas a valid exercise of the President’s Antiquities Act\\nauthority, and the Proclamation was fully consistent with the\\nO&C Act.\\n    Judge Tallman concurred in part because he agreed that\\nthe court could review claims that the President’s execution\\nof one statute obstructed the operation of another. However,\\nhe dissented from the majority’s conclusion that\\nProclamation 9564 did not conflict with the O&C Act. He\\nwrote that the issue of whether the Antiquities Act and the\\nO&C Act can coexist in the abstract is beside the point.\\nRather, the court must decide whether Proclamation 9564—\\nissued pursuant to the Antiquities Act—conflicts with the\\nO&C Act. A review of the plain text of the Proclamation\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    5\\n\\n\\nand the O&C Act reveals an obvious conflict. The O&C Act\\nrequires sustained yield calculation for all O&C\\ntimberlands. Proclamation 9564 removes O&C timberlands\\nfrom the sustained yield calculation if they fall within the\\nmonument. By expressly singling out sustained yield\\ncalculation for prohibition, the President’s proclamation\\nintentionally directs the Secretary to disregard her statutory\\nduties under the O&C Act to make sure that timber is\\navailable for harvest to meet economic needs of timber-\\ndependent communities. Judge Tallman wrote that he would\\ngive effect to the plain meaning of the O&C Act and declare\\nthe Proclamation void as to O&C timberland.\\n\\n\\n\\n                        COUNSEL\\n\\nJulie A.

BIDEN\\n\\n\\n                          OPINION\\n\\nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge:\\n    This case calls on us to consider the intersection of the\\nAntiquities Act, adopted in 1906, and the Oregon and\\nCalifornia Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands\\nAct (“O&C Act”), adopted in 1937. The Antiquities Act\\ngrants the President broad authority to create, by presidential\\nproclamation, national monuments from federal lands to\\nprotect sites of historic and scientific interest. See 54 U.S.C.\\n§ 320301(a)–(b). In contrast, the O&C Act is much\\nnarrower in scope, addressing the use of timberlands in the\\nsouthwest corner of Oregon. See 43 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.\\n    In January 2017, President Obama issued a Proclamation\\nunder the Antiquities Act expanding the Cascade-Siskiyou\\nNational Monument (“Monument”) in southwestern\\nOregon. Proclamation 9564 (“Proclamation”), 82 Fed. Reg.\\n6145 (Jan. 12, 2017). First established in 2000 by President\\nClinton, the Monument boasts “an incredible variety of\\nspecies and habitats,” which form “a rich mosaic of forests,\\ngrasslands, shrublands, and wet meadows.” Id. The\\nexpanded Monument’s 101,000 acres, which intersect with\\nthe ancestral homes of several Native American peoples,\\nalso overlap with timberlands regulated by the O&C Act.\\nWith limited exceptions, logging is banned within the\\nMonument.\\n   Murphy Timber Company and Murphy Timber\\nInvestments, LLC (collectively, “Murphy”) are Oregon\\ntimber businesses. Murphy owns woodlands and purchases\\ntimber harvested in western Oregon to supply its wood-\\nproducts manufacturing facilities. Concerned that the\\nProclamation imposed a new limitation on its timber supply\\n\f                    MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    7\\n\\n\\nand deleterious effects on its woodlands adjacent to the\\nexpanded Monument, Murphy sued the President, the\\nSecretary of the Interior (“Secretary”), and the Bureau of\\nLand Management (“BLM”) seeking declaratory and\\ninjunctive relief. Although Murphy named the Secretary and\\nBLM as defendants, the suit does not challenge any specific,\\nfinal agency action. Murphy claims that the Proclamation is\\nan invalid exercise of the Antiquities Act because it offends\\nthe O&C Act’s promise to reserve certain lands for timber\\nproduction. A collection of environmental organizations\\n(together, “Soda Mountain”) intervened to defend the\\nProclamation.\\n    The dispute poses two questions for our review. We first\\nconsider whether Murphy’s claim of ultra vires and\\nunconstitutional action with respect to the Proclamation is\\nimmune from judicial review. Because we conclude that we\\nhave jurisdiction to hear Murphy’s challenge, we next\\nevaluate whether the Proclamation’s restriction on logging\\nis consistent with the O&C Act. Admittedly, the validity of\\nthe Proclamation—an Antiquities Act order that implicates\\nthe O&C Act—presents a statutory thicket. But, ultimately,\\nMurphy’s claim of irreconcilability misses the forest for the\\ntrees. The Antiquities Act and the later-enacted O&C Act\\nare not irreconcilable, nor did the O&C Act repeal the\\nAntiquities Act. The Proclamation is consistent with the\\nO&C Act’s flexible land-management directives, which\\nincorporate conservation uses. And, notably, only a tiny\\npercentage of the several million acres covered by the O&C\\nAct (“O&C Lands”) fall within the expanded Monument’s\\nterritory. The Secretary retains broad discretion over the\\nmillions of acres remaining. The Proclamation does not\\nusurp congressional intent or the Secretary’s authority to\\nregulate the O&C Lands as a whole. We affirm the district\\n\f8                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United\\nStates and Soda Mountain.\\nI. BACKGROUND\\n    A. THE ANTIQUITIES ACT AND PROCLAMATION 9564\\n    The Antiquities Act delegates to Presidents, in their\\n“discretion,” the power to designate “historic landmarks,\\nhistoric and prehistoric structures, and other objects of\\nhistoric or scientific interest” as national monuments and to\\n“reserve parcels of land” for protection. 54 U.S.C.\\n§ 320301(a)–(b). The meaning of “monument” under the\\nstatute encompasses mountains and deserts, as much as it\\ndoes physical statues or icons. See Mark Squillace, The\\nMonumental Legacy of the Antiquities Act of 1906, 37 Ga.\\nL. Rev. 473, 477–86 (2003). Indeed, Theodore Roosevelt,\\nthe President at the time of the Act’s passage and a noted\\nconservationist, designated eighteen monuments spanning\\napproximately 1.5 million acres under this new law. See id.\\nat 474 n.6. In the years since, all but three Presidents have\\nexercised their Antiquities Act authority.           National\\nMonument Facts and Figures, Nat’l Park Serv.,\\nhttps://www.nps.gov/subjects/archeology/national-monume\\nnt-facts-and-figures.htm (last updated Mar. 27, 2023).\\nProclamations by Presidents Obama, Trump, and Biden have\\nbrought the total number of national monument enactments\\nto 161. Id. President Biden recently announced two new\\nmonuments: the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in\\nNevada and the Castner Range National Monument in\\nTexas. White House Statements and Releases (Mar. 21,\\n2023).\\n    This case concerns one such set of designations. In June\\n2000, President Clinton reserved nearly 53,000 acres of\\nfederal land as the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     9\\n\\n\\nfor its “spectacular” biodiversity. Proclamation 7318, 65\\nFed. Reg. 37249, 37249 (June 9, 2000). The President\\nproclaimed, “[w]ith towering fir forests, sunlit oak groves,\\nwildflower-strewn meadows, and steep canyons, the\\nCascade-Siskiyou National Monument is an ecological\\nwonder, with biological diversity unmatched in the Cascade\\nRange.” Id. Logging was banned within the Monument\\nexcept in limited circumstances:\\n\\n       The commercial harvest of timber or other\\n       vegetative material is prohibited, except\\n       when part of an authorized science-based\\n       ecological restoration project aimed at\\n       meeting protection and old growth\\n       enhancement objectives. Any such project\\n       must be consistent with the purposes of this\\n       proclamation. No portion of the monument\\n       shall be considered to be suited for timber\\n       production, and no part of the monument\\n       shall be used in a calculation or provision of\\n       a sustained yield of timber. Removal of trees\\n       from within the monument area may take\\n       place only if clearly needed for ecological\\n       restoration and maintenance or public safety.\\n\\nId. at 37250.\\n    In 2011, a group of scientists issued a report finding that\\nexpanding the Monument was “required to fully protect the\\nunique biological diversity of the area.” Many local\\nOregonians expressed their support for the scientists’\\nexpansion plan. Heeding their call, President Obama in\\n2017 issued Proclamation 9564, expanding the Monument\\nby approximately 48,000 acres. 82 Fed. Reg. at 6145, 6148.\\n\f10                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nThe expansion provided “habitat connectivity corridors for\\nspecies migration and dispersal” to better permit the\\nMonument’s diverse species to be “resilient to large-scale\\ndisturbance such as fire, insects and disease, invasive\\nspecies, drought, or floods.” Id. at 6145. Further, the\\nProclamation prohibited logging within the expanded area.\\nId. at 6148–49. Both the original Monument and its\\nexpansion overlap in part with the land managed under the\\nO&C Act. Though the parties offer competing calculations\\nabout what constitutes “timberland,” the precise degree of\\noverlap is not consequential to our decision. Following the\\nProclamation, BLM—the agency within the Department of\\nthe Interior (“Department”) responsible for administering\\nfederal lands—halted timber sales within the expanded\\nMonument.\\n     B. THE O&C ACT\\n    The O&C Act descends from the fraught history of\\nAmerica’s westward expansion, punctuated as it was by the\\nexploitation of natural resources and federal money. In\\n1866, the United States made a grant of purportedly “public\\nlands” to private railroad companies to facilitate the\\nconstruction of a rail line between Oregon and California.\\nClackamas County v. McKay, 219 F.2d 479, 481, 484 (D.C.\\nCir. 1954) (citing Act of July 25, 1866, ch. 242, 14 Stat. 239),\\njudgment vacated as moot, 349 U.S. 909 (1955). Congress\\nin 1869 directed the railroads to sell the granted land to\\n“actual settlers only.” Act of Apr. 10, 1869, ch. 27, 16 Stat.\\n47. But the railroads violated the terms of the grant and, by\\n1893, had failed to dispose of the vast majority of the\\nparcels. See Clackamas, 219 F.2d at 482; Richard White,\\nRailroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of\\nModern America 459 (2011).\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                   11\\n\\n\\n    Consequently, in 1916, Congress revested much of the\\nland and directed the Secretary to sell the timber “as rapidly\\nas reasonable prices can be secured.” Act of June 9, 1916,\\nPub. L. No. 86, ch. 137, 39 Stat. 218, 220. But the 1916 Act\\nwas “more a triumph of expediency than a statesmanlike\\nsolution,” and its convoluted timber-for-taxes funding\\nscheme left many Oregon counties in “dire financial straits.”\\nDavid Maldwyn Ellis, The Oregon and California Railroad\\nLand Grant, 1866-1945, 39 Pac. N.W. Q. 253, 273, 275\\n(1948). In 1926, Congress’s next attempt at alleviating the\\nfinancial burden also failed, merely shifting the debts from\\nthe counties onto the U.S. Treasury. Act of July 13, 1926,\\nPub. L. No. 523, ch. 897, 44 Stat. 915; Ellis, supra, at 275.\\n    Finally, in 1937, Congress passed the O&C Act to\\nremedy in part the region’s perilous economic and\\nenvironmental situation. Clackamas, 219 F.2d at 485–86.\\nThe O&C Act provided “for the management of the timber\\non a conservation basis,” and accorded significant discretion\\nto the Secretary of the Interior when it came to\\n“classification of land” and “sale of timber.” Id. at 487. The\\nstatute reads, in part:\\n\\n       [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and\\n       California Railroad and reconveyed Coos\\n       Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may\\n       hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the\\n       Department of the Interior, which have\\n       heretofore or may hereafter be classified as\\n       timberlands, and power-site lands valuable\\n       for timber, shall be managed . . . for\\n       permanent forest production, and the timber\\n       thereon shall be sold, cut, and removed in\\n       conformity with the principal [sic] of\\n\f12                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\n       sustained yield for the purpose of providing a\\n       permanent source of timber supply,\\n       protecting watersheds, regulating stream\\n       flow, and contributing to the economic\\n       stability of local communities and industries,\\n       and providing recreational facilties [sic].\\n\\n43 U.S.C. § 2601. The statute’s remaining sections detail\\nthe Secretary’s duties and discretion to limit the Lands’\\nannual timber capacity in compliance with the principle of\\nsustained yield. Id.\\n    In the decades since, BLM has managed the more than\\ntwo million acres of O&C Lands in keeping with changing\\nconditions. For instance, the annual amount of timber that\\nBLM allows to be sold has fluctuated, starting at 500 million\\nboard feet per year in 1937, peaking at more than 1 billion\\nboard feet in 1972, and hitting a low of 13 million board feet\\nin 1994. Katie Hoover, Cong. Rsch. Serv. R42951, The\\nOregon and California Railroad Lands (O&C Lands):\\nIssues for Congress 3, 5 fig. 3 (2015). The contested lands\\nare but a small fraction of the vast acreage managed by\\nBLM. In addition to timber management, BLM has guided\\nconservation activities on the O&C Lands.               BLM\\nregulations, adopted to implement the O&C Act, have\\nauthorized the agency to “preserve, protect, and enhance\\nareas of scenic splendor, natural wonder, scientific interest,\\nprimitive environment, and other natural values for the\\nenjoyment and use of present and future generations.”\\nPortland Audubon Soc’y v. Lujan, 795 F. Supp. 1489, 1506\\n(D. Or. 1992) (quoting 43 C.F.R. § 6220.0-1), modified,\\n1992 WL 176353 (D. Or.), and aff’d sub nom. Portland\\nAudubon Soc’y v. Babbitt, 998 F.2d 705 (9th Cir. 1993).\\nFollowing the Monument’s designation and expansion,\\n\f                      MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     13\\n\\n\\nBLM removed Monument lands from its analyses of annual\\nsustained yield and halted logging on those lands. To date,\\nBLM has offered one timber sale within the original\\nMonument in accordance with Proclamation 7318’s\\nprovision for such harvest if it is “clearly needed for\\necological restoration and maintenance or public safety.”\\nSee 65 Fed. Reg. at 37250.\\n    C. THIS LITIGATION\\n    In February 2017, Murphy brought suit in the District of\\nOregon seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the\\nPresident, the Secretary, and BLM. Murphy alleged that\\nPresident Obama’s Proclamation 9564 designation of O&C\\nLands as Monument land violated the “timber production\\npurpose” of the O&C Act and the President therefore lacked\\nauthority under the Antiquities Act to do so. Murphy also\\nclaimed that the Proclamation’s restrictions on logging also\\npose increased risks of wildfire and insect infestation. For\\nrelief, Murphy requested vacatur of the Proclamation as to\\nthe O&C Lands in the expansion, an injunction requiring the\\ngovernment to manage O&C Lands exclusively pursuant to\\nthe O&C Act, and a declaration as to the Proclamation’s\\ninvalidity. Soda Mountain Wilderness Council and other\\nenvironmental organizations intervened.\\n     In June 2017, the district court stayed the litigation after\\nPresident Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to\\nreview certain prior Antiquities Act designations, including\\nthe Monument expansion. The Secretary recommended\\nreducing the size of the Monument, but President Trump did\\nnot act on the recommendations. No final agency action\\nemerged from this review. Eventually, the district court\\nlifted the stay in February 2018, and all parties moved for\\nsummary judgment. The government argued that sovereign\\n\f14                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nimmunity bars Murphy’s claim against the President and that\\nthe Proclamation and the O&C Act do not irreconcilably\\nconflict. Granting summary judgment for the United States\\nand Soda Mountain, the district court concluded that it had\\njurisdiction to review whether the President had acted ultra\\nvires and held that the Proclamation was consistent both with\\nthe President’s Antiquities Act authority and with the O&C\\nAct’s land-management directives.\\nII. ANALYSIS\\n     A. JUSTICIABILITY\\n    Before addressing the merits of Murphy’s statutory\\nclaims, we first consider whether we have authority to do so.\\nSovereign immunity generally bars suits against the United\\nStates and its officials sued in their official capacity unless\\nCongress has expressly waived immunity by statute. Lane\\nv. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). Where Congress has not\\nwaived sovereign immunity, judicial review is never\\navailable “when the statute in question commits the decision\\nto the discretion of the President.” Dalton v. Specter, 511\\nU.S. 462, 474 (1994). In the absence of a statutory waiver,\\nthe Supreme Court has permitted judicial review of\\npresidential actions in two circumstances.\\n    First, the Court has recognized constitutional challenges\\nto presidential acts as reviewable.         In Franklin v.\\nMassachusetts, the state of Massachusetts and two of its\\nregistered voters sued the President, the Secretary of\\nCommerce, Census Bureau officials, and the Clerk of the\\nHouse of Representatives over reapportionment policy,\\nparticularly regarding the method used for counting federal\\nemployees serving overseas. 505 U.S. 788, 790–91 (1992).\\nThe Court held that the President’s actions could “be\\nreviewed for constitutionality,” even though they were “not\\n\f                      MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     15\\n\\n\\nreviewable for abuse of discretion” under the Administrative\\nProcedure Act. Id. at 801; see also Dalton, 511 U.S. at 467–\\n72 (reaffirming the Franklin principle that “Presidential\\ndecisions are reviewable for constitutionality” but clarifying\\nthat not all claims alleging action in excess of statutory\\nauthority are “ipso facto in violation of the Constitution”).\\n    Second, the Court has held that actions by subordinate\\nExecutive Branch officials that extend beyond delegated\\nstatutory authority—i.e., ultra vires actions—are\\nreviewable. See Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp.,\\n337 U.S. 682, 689–90 (1949). In Larson, the case in which\\nthis theory was first articulated, a corporate plaintiff sued the\\nhead of the War Assets Administration in the wake of World\\nWar II, alleging the government breached a contract to sell\\nthe corporation its surplus coal. Id. at 684. Although the\\nplaintiff’s suit was “nominally addressed to” the\\nAdministrator, the Court affirmed dismissal on sovereign\\nimmunity grounds because it was “in substance, a suit\\nagainst the Government.” Id. at 687–90. But in reaching\\nthis conclusion, the Court articulated an important\\nexception: sovereign immunity does not shield an executive\\nofficer from suit for actions in “conflict with the terms of his\\nvalid statutory authority.” Id. at 695; see also Dalton, 511\\nU.S. at 472 (underscoring that “sovereign immunity [does]\\nnot shield an executive officer from suit if the officer acted\\neither ‘unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers.’”\\n(quoting Larson, 337 U.S. at 691 n.11)).\\n    Here, as a threshold matter, the United States urges that\\nProclamation 9564 is immune from judicial review. The\\ngovernment argues that because no statute waives sovereign\\nimmunity or provides a cause of action for Murphy’s claims,\\nstatutory judicial review is unavailable.         Next, the\\ngovernment contends that even ultra vires review of\\n\f16                    MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nMurphy’s statutory claim is unavailable because the\\nPresident acted pursuant to authority delegated by Congress\\nunder the Antiquities Act, and the O&C Act does not\\nregulate the President’s discretion, only that of the Secretary\\nof the Interior. Murphy does not dispute that the Antiquities\\nAct grants the President the authority to designate national\\nmonuments; instead, Murphy contends that Proclamation\\n9564, in particular, is reviewable as an ultra vires act.\\nBecause the O&C Act places a “reviewable limit” on the\\nPresident’s authority to designate monuments under the\\nAntiquities Act, Murphy argues, Larson creates an exception\\nto sovereign immunity that allows jurisdiction.\\n    Although neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth\\nCircuit has directly addressed whether the Larson exception\\napplies to actions by the President, apart from the actions of\\nsubordinate Executive Branch officials, precedent and\\nprinciple point in favor of jurisdiction here.               The\\nreviewability of Murphy’s claim that the Secretary cannot\\nmanage O&C Lands contrary to the O&C Act is a simpler\\nquestion. Yet, because Murphy’s claims against the\\nSecretary and against the President are thoroughly\\ninterwoven, the justiciability of each demands a judicial\\nanswer. Murphy’s complaint is not pristinely clear about the\\nappropriate avenue to jurisdiction. In addition to Murphy’s\\narguments under Larson, Murphy’s challenge implicates\\nseparation of powers concerns that resonate with the\\nconstitutional claims recognized in Franklin. Yet, whether\\ncharacterized as ultra vires or constitutional, the result is the\\nsame: we resolve that Murphy’s claims against the President\\nregarding Proclamation 9564 are justiciable.\\n    When faced with such a “difficult question” of the\\nreviewability of certain executive actions, the Supreme\\nCourt has in recent years adopted the practice of “assum[ing]\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    17\\n\\n\\nwithout deciding” justiciability. See Trump v. Hawaii, 138\\nS. Ct. 2392, 2407 (2018); see also id. at 2407 (noting that the\\nCourt in Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155\\n(1993), “went on to consider on the merits a statutory claim\\nlike the one before us without addressing the issue of\\nreviewability”).       But relying only on “hypothetical\\njurisdiction” risks rendering the disposition “nothing more\\nthan a hypothetical judgment” and thereby diluting the\\nseparation of powers. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\\nEnv’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998). Here, Murphy does not\\nallege that Proclamation 9564 constituted an abuse of\\ndiscretion beyond the Antiquities Act guidelines; rather,\\nMurphy maintains that the President’s exercise of discretion\\nunder the Antiquities Act independently violates the O&C\\nAct. In other words, Murphy’s claim asks only that we apply\\nour familiar tools of statutory construction and fulfill our\\nenduring “duty . . . to say what the law is.” Marbury v.\\nMadison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803). Longstanding judicial\\npractice, therefore, urges that we explicitly decide the issue\\nof justiciability in this case.\\n    Contemporary Ninth Circuit jurisprudence weighs in\\nfavor of justiciability by taking an expansive view of the\\nconstitutional category of claims highlighted in Dalton. In\\nSierra Club v. Trump, for example, we held that a challenge\\nto presidential action will be considered constitutional, and\\ntherefore justiciable under Franklin, so long as a plaintiff\\nclaims that the President has “violat[ed] . . . constitutional\\nseparation of powers principles” because the President’s\\naction lacked both “statutory authority” and “background\\nconstitutional authority.” 929 F.3d 670, 696–97 (9th Cir.\\n2019); see also Sierra Club v. Trump, 963 F.3d 874, 889–90\\n(9th Cir. 2020) (reiterating that claims alleging the President\\nviolated the Constitution by exceeding statutory authority\\n\f18                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nare justiciable as constitutional claims), vacated and\\nremanded on other grounds sub nom. Biden v. Sierra Club,\\n142 S. Ct. 46 (2021). While “an action taken by the\\nPresident in excess of his statutory authority [does not]\\nnecessarily violate[] the Constitution,” Dalton, 511 U.S. at\\n473, specific allegations regarding separation of powers may\\nsuffice. Here, the core of Murphy’s claim—that the\\nPresident violated separation of powers by directing the\\nSecretary to act in contravention of a duly enacted law—\\ncould be considered constitutional and therefore reviewable.\\n    The D.C. Circuit has had occasion to review analogous\\ncases concerning the reviewability of claims against the\\nPresident. In Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, plaintiffs\\nchallenged President Clinton’s executive order, issued\\npursuant to his Procurement Act authority, that barred the\\nfederal government from contracting with employees\\nreplacing striking workers. 74 F.3d 1322, 1324 (D.C. Cir.\\n1996). The court determined that it had jurisdiction to\\nreview plaintiffs’ claims that the order constituted “a\\npalpable violation” of the National Labor Relations Act. Id.\\n    In two other cases, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged\\njurisdiction over ultra vires allegations but ultimately\\nconcluded that the claims failed because of insufficient\\nfactual allegations. Plaintiffs in Mountain States Legal\\nFoundation v. Bush challenged the creation of six national\\nmonuments, alleging the President acted ultra vires under\\nthe Antiquities Act and contrary to other federal statutes.\\n306 F.3d 1132, 1133–34 (D.C. Cir. 2002). The D.C. Circuit\\nexplained that Dalton’s restriction on reviewing presidential\\nacts for abuse of discretion “‘is inapposite’ . . . ‘where the\\nclaim instead is that the presidential action . . .\\nindependently violates’ another statute.” Id. at 1136\\n(quoting Reich, 74 F.3d at 1332). The court proceeded to\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    19\\n\\n\\nreview and reject plaintiffs’ argument that the presidential\\naction did indeed independently violate another statute, thus\\naffirming dismissal on the merits for failure to state a claim.\\nId. at 1138. Applying this standard, the D.C. Circuit in\\nMassachusetts Lobstermen’s Association v. Ross concluded\\nthat plaintiffs’ claims “that interpreting the Antiquities Act\\nto permit ocean-based monuments would render the\\nSanctuaries Act a practical nullity” were justiciable but\\nwithout merit. 945 F.3d 535, 541, 544 (D.C. Cir. 2019)\\n(internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied sub nom.\\nMass. Lobstermen’s Ass’n v. Raimondo, 141 S. Ct. 979\\n(2021).\\n    Against this backdrop, Murphy’s allegations are\\nsufficient to establish jurisdiction. Our resolution should not\\nbe read to empower future objectors to frame any unpopular\\npresidential action as “ultra vires” and thus open the\\nfloodgates to frivolous judicial challenges that hinder the\\nPresident’s power to respond to pressing issues. The\\nSupreme Court has emphasized that dismissal for lack of\\njurisdiction is warranted if the alleged claim of statutory\\nexcess is made “solely for the purpose of obtaining\\njurisdiction or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.” See\\nLarson, 337 U.S. at 690 n.10. And, again, the Court has\\nstipulated that not every ultra vires claim will necessarily\\nimplicate constitutional concerns. See Dalton, 511 U.S. at\\n472. As the D.C. Circuit held in Mountain States Legal\\nFoundation, plaintiffs advancing ultra vires claims must\\nplead “plausible factual allegations identifying an aspect of\\nthe designation that exceeds the President’s statutory\\nauthority.” 306 F.3d at 1136–37. Far from providing\\n“only the bald assertion that the President acted outside the\\nbounds of his . . . statutory authority,” id. at 1137, Murphy’s\\nparticularized allegations that the O&C Act restricts the\\n\f20                       MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nPresident’s designation powers under the Antiquities Act\\nsatisfies the jurisdictional standard set forth here and\\nelsewhere. 1\\n     B. THE ANTIQUITIES ACT’S CONSISTENCY WITH THE\\n        O&C ACT\\n    No party challenges President Obama’s general\\nauthority to expand the Monument under the Antiquities\\nAct. And for good reason—that authority is not inconsistent\\nwith the scope of the O&C Act. Murphy urges that the O&C\\nAct’s directive of “permanent forest production”\\ncircumscribed the scope of presidential authority over these\\nspecific lands. But Murphy overreads the extent of\\ncongressional commitment to timber production in the O&C\\nAct and improperly discounts the considerable discretion\\nthat the statute grants the Department in managing O&C\\nLands for uses other than timber. After reviewing the O&C\\nAct’s plain text and legislative history, we hold that the\\nProclamation is a valid exercise of the President’s\\nAntiquities Act authority.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n  Our conclusion that Murphy has credibly alleged a statutory conflict\\ndoes not dictate our determination on the merits. The pleading burdens\\nwith respect to jurisdiction and the merits are not coterminous when the\\nclaim is that the challenged action violates a separate statute conferring\\nno authority on the President. See Reich, 74 F.3d at 1330–31 (stressing\\nthat “it is important carefully to distinguish between the government’s\\nargument on the merits and its non-reviewability claim” in ultra vires\\nsuits involving two or more statutes because the fact that a statute affords\\nthe President “broad authority”—though weighing heavily on the\\nmerits—does not “preclude[] judicial review of executive action for\\nconformity with that statute—let alone review to determine whether that\\naction violates another statute.”).\\n\f                      MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     21\\n\\n\\n        1. The O&C Act did not repeal the Antiquities\\n           Act.\\n    The O&C Act did not explicitly or implicitly repeal the\\nAntiquities Act. To begin, the two statutes are directed at\\ndifferent officials: the Antiquities Act vests authority in the\\nPresident, while the O&C Act concerns the Secretary and\\nsays nothing about presidential authority. See Sale, 509 U.S.\\nat 171–79 (considering statutes’ direction at different\\nofficials as a persuasive factor in reconciling a statute and an\\nexecutive order). Nor does the O&C Act make any reference\\nto the preexisting Antiquities Act. The Supreme Court has\\ncounseled, “when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it\\nis the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed\\ncongressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as\\neffective.” Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551 (1974).\\nThe Antiquities Act and the O&C Act are easily “capable of\\nco-existence.”\\n    Lacking any evidence of an explicit repeal, Murphy\\ncontends that the Antiquities Act and the O&C Act are\\nirreconcilable because the latter act’s non-obstante clause\\nimplicitly repealed the President’s power under the\\nAntiquities Act. By its terms, that non-obstante clause\\napplies only if there is a statutory conflict: “All Acts or parts\\nof Acts in conflict with this Act are hereby repealed to the\\nextent necessary to give full force and effect to this Act.”\\nSee Act of Aug. 28, 1937, ch. 876, 50 Stat. 876. Murphy\\n“faces a stout uphill climb” against the “strong presumption\\nthat repeals by implication are disfavored.” Epic Sys. Corp.\\nv. Lewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018) (internal quotation\\nmarks omitted). In urging that the Antiquities Act and the\\nO&C Act “cannot be harmonized,” Murphy “bears the heavy\\nburden of showing a clearly expressed congressional\\nintention that such a result should follow.” Id. (internal\\n\f22                  MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nquotation marks omitted). Murphy points to no such\\nevidence of congressional intent to repeal the Antiquities\\nAct. In fact, the O&C Act’s legislative history does not\\ncontain any reference to the Antiquities Act, even though the\\n1906 law was hardly itself an antiquity by 1937, when the\\nO&C Act came into existence. President Franklin Delano\\nRoosevelt exercised his monument-making power eight\\ntimes that year alone. National Monument Facts and\\nFigures, supra. Rather, the legislative record supports that\\nCongress likely included the non-obstante clause as a fail-\\nsafe to ensure that the 1937 O&C Act superseded the tangle\\nof statutes that had previously regulated the O&C Lands.\\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 75-1119, at 2–4 (1937).\\n    When Congress has wished to restrict the President’s\\nAntiquities Act authority, it has done so expressly.\\nConsider, for instance, the highly public dispute between\\nCongress and President Roosevelt over the establishment of\\nthe Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. That year,\\nPresident Roosevelt proclaimed 221,610 acres of federal\\nland in Wyoming as a national monument of historic\\nsignificance under the Antiquities Act, brushing aside strong\\nindications from Congress that they would disapprove of\\nsuch a move. See Robert W. Righter, Crucible for\\nConservation: The Creation of Grand Teton National Park\\n109–10 (1982). Opposition to the monument was fierce, and\\nCongress reacted almost immediately: it appointed a joint\\ncongressional committee to investigate the issue, and, a few\\nyears later, it passed legislation that prohibited “further\\nextension or establishment of national parks or monuments\\nin Wyoming” without “express authorization” from\\nCongress. See Act of Sept. 14, 1950, Pub. L. No. 787, § 1,\\n64 Stat. 849, 849; see also Righter, supra, 110–19, 123–25.\\nTo take another example, in response to President Carter in\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                   23\\n\\n\\n1978 establishing more than 50 million acres across Alaska\\nas national monuments, Congress passed a law requiring that\\nthe President seek congressional approval for land\\nwithdrawals larger than 5,000 acres throughout the entire\\nstate. See Act of Dec. 2, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-487,\\n§ 1326(a), 94 Stat. 2371, 2488. Here, there is every reason\\nto believe that if Congress had intended the restrictions of\\nthe O&C Act to apply when the President shifted the land\\nuse in question, Congress would speak as clearly and\\npromptly here as it did in the cases of Alaska and Wyoming.\\nBut no such action was here taken.\\n    More broadly, the fact that the Supreme Court has never\\noverturned an Antiquities Act proclamation underscores the\\nstatute’s vitality. See United States v. California, 436 U.S.\\n32, 35–36 (1978) (confirming the President’s Antiquities\\nAct power to add federally controlled lands to an existing\\nmonument); Cameron v. United States, 252 U.S. 450, 455\\n(1920) (affirming the President’s authority under the\\nAntiquities Act to create a Grand Canyon National\\nMonument); see also Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S.\\n128, 141–42 (1976) (holding that the “language of the\\n[Antiquities] Act . . . is not so limited” and includes the\\nauthority to reserve rights to unappropriated water within a\\nnational monument). In one such historical case, the Court\\nnoted that the scope of President Truman’s enlargement of a\\nnational monument in California was “a question only of\\nPresidential intent, not of Presidential power.” United States\\nv. California, 436 U.S. at 36.\\n   Thus, nothing supports a claim that the Antiquities Act\\nproclamations are broadsides at land-management laws and\\ncannot coexist with preexisting congressional mandates.\\nThere is no basis to suggest that Congress intended the O&C\\n\f24                  MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nAct to nullify the Antiquities Act—which was, after all,\\nitself an act of Congress.\\n        2. The Proclamation’s Exercise of Antiquities\\n           Act Power is Consistent with the Text,\\n           History, and Purpose of the O&C Act.\\n    The Proclamation’s exercise of Antiquities Act power is\\nconsistent with the O&C Act. The O&C Act’s text, history,\\nand purpose are clear that timber production was not the sole\\npurpose that Congress envisioned for the more than two\\nmillion acres of O&C Lands. Congress delegated ample\\ndiscretion to the Department of the Interior to manage the\\nlands in a flexible manner.\\n     a. Text\\n    When “the meaning of the statute’s terms is plain,” the\\ncourt’s job “is at an end.” Bostock v. Clayton County, 140\\nS. Ct. 1731, 1749 (2020). Here, the O&C Act’s plain\\nlanguage empowers the Department to classify and manage\\nthe revested and reconveyed lands for several purposes—\\npredominantly, but not exclusively, timber production. We\\ncannot ignore the conservation provisions of the Act. As the\\nD.C. Circuit long ago recognized, the O&C Act “conferred\\nupon the Secretary of the Interior many duties requiring the\\nexercise of his discretion and judgment.” Clackamas, 219\\nF.2d at 487. The opening paragraph of the O&C Act reveals\\nthe breadth of congressional purpose:\\n\\n        [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and\\n        California Railroad and reconveyed Coos\\n        Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may\\n        hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the\\n        Department of the Interior, which have\\n        heretofore or may hereafter be classified as\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    25\\n\\n\\n       timberlands, and power-site lands valuable\\n       for timber, shall be managed . . . for\\n       permanent forest production, and the timber\\n       thereon shall be sold, cut, and removed in\\n       conformity with the principal [sic] of\\n       sustained yield for the purpose of providing a\\n       permanent source of timber supply,\\n       protecting watersheds, regulating stream\\n       flow, and contributing to the economic\\n       stability of local communities and industries,\\n       and providing recreational facilties [sic].\\n\\n43 U.S.C. § 2601 (emphasis added).\\n    The first italicized provision indicates that not all O&C\\nLands were to be operated as timberlands. Instead, the\\nstatute directs the Department to determine which portions\\nof the land should be set aside for logging and which should\\nbe reserved. The Department’s duty to oversee the lands is\\nobligatory (“shall be managed”), but treating every parcel as\\ntimberland is not. Reading the statute differently would\\nrender the “heretofore” phrase mere surplusage and “run[]\\nafoul of the ‘cardinal principle’ of interpretation that courts\\n‘must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\\nstatute.’” Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.S. 351, 358\\n(2014) (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404\\n(2000)). Murphy concedes as much in acknowledging that\\n“[s]ome O&C Act lands are not subject to the statutes’\\nsustained-yield timber production mandates.” Obviously,\\nMurphy can’t pick and choose which parcels should be\\nclassified as protected timberlands. Otherwise, Murphy’s\\nargument would place the court or the timber company in the\\ndriver’s seat and divest the Department of authority to make\\n\f26                  MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\ndynamic, scientific decisions about which parcels should or\\nshould not be logged.\\n    Importantly, the statute authorizes the Department to\\nmanage the O&C Lands for uses other than timber\\nproduction. While “providing a permanent source of timber\\nsupply” is certainly primary, the Act delineates a number of\\npurposes for the Lands: “protecting watersheds, regulating\\nstream flow, and contributing to the economic stability of\\nlocal communities and industries, and providing recreational\\nfacil[i]ties.” 43 U.S.C. § 2601. Our earlier decision in\\nHeadwaters, Inc. v. BLM, Medford District, 914 F.2d 1174\\n(9th Cir. 1990), which dealt specifically with the O&C Act,\\ndoes not counsel a different conclusion. To be sure,\\nHeadwaters held that “the O & C Act envisions timber\\nproduction as a dominant use,” and rejected an\\nenvironmental group’s proposal to exempt “certain timber\\nresources from harvesting to serve as wildlife habitat”\\nbecause it was “inconsistent with the principle of sustained\\nyield.” Id. at 1183–84. But in Headwaters we never held\\nthat the O&C Act required timber production to be the\\nexclusive use of O&C Land. Although saving the spotted\\nowl might have been beyond Congress’s vision of “forest\\nproduction,” id. at 1183, the statute’s specific reference to\\n“watersheds” and “recreational facil[i]ties” underscores that\\nCongress contemplated alternative, secondary uses for the\\nlands. Of note, Headwaters did not evaluate the O&C Act\\nin the context, at issue here, of reconciling its statutory\\ndemands with the Antiquities Act. Ultimately, we affirmed\\nBLM’s exercise of discretion to manage the tract of O&C\\nLand at issue as it saw fit—in that case, for logging. Id. at\\n1183–84.\\n   Our reading of the O&C Act does not diverge from\\nHeadwaters’s recognition of the discretion vested in the\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                    27\\n\\n\\nDepartment and BLM, a principle we apply here. We have\\nrepeatedly reinforced that the O&C Act grants the\\nDepartment broad discretion to manage the lands in a\\nflexible manner. For instance, in Portland Audubon Society\\nv. Babbitt, we considered an analogous clash between the\\nO&C Act and the National Environmental Policy Act\\n(“NEPA”). 998 F.2d 705 (9th Cir. 1993). Environmental\\ngroups sued BLM for failing to prepare a Supplemental\\nEnvironmental Impact Statement under NEPA in light of the\\npresence of northern spotted owls on O&C Land used for\\nlogging. Id. at 707. Affirming the district court, we\\nunderscored BLM’s discretion to manage O&C Land for\\nmultiple purposes, holding that “the plain language of the\\n[O&C] Act supports the . . . conclusion that the Act has not\\ndeprived the BLM of all discretion with regard to either the\\n[timber] volume requirements of the Act or the management\\nof the lands entrusted to its care.” Id. at 709. In the absence\\nof a “clear and unavoidable conflict” between the two\\nstatutes, BLM could not use “an excessively narrow\\nconstruction of its existing statutory authorizations” under\\nthe O&C Act to avoid compliance with NEPA. Id. (citation\\nomitted). Portland Audubon Society thus reinforces the\\nnotion that BLM has latitude to reserve O&C Act land from\\nlogging in light of competing directives.\\n    Just a few years later, in Seattle Audubon Society v.\\nMoseley, we considered a logging-industry challenge to\\nBLM’s designation of certain O&C Lands as a spotted-owl\\nhabitat. 80 F.3d 1401 (9th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). The\\ndistrict court concluded that BLM’s “management decision\\nmade here in regard to the [O&C] lands was a lawful\\nexercise of the Secretary’s discretion.” Seattle Audubon\\nSoc’y v. Lyons, 871 F. Supp. 1291, 1314 (W.D. Wash. 1994).\\nWe affirmed. Moseley, 80 F.3d at 1406.\\n\f28                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\n    Together, these decisions reinforce our conclusion that\\nthe O&C Act’s plain text envisions economic, recreational,\\nand environmental uses for the O&C Lands beyond logging\\nand grants the Department significant discretion in how to\\nachieve statutory compliance.\\n     b. History and Purpose\\n    The O&C Act’s legislative history confirms our reading\\nof the statute’s plain language. Congress drafted the O&C\\nAct to address “two basic criticisms” of its 1916 and 1926\\nstatutory predecessors: “they required the timber to be sold\\nas rapidly as possible and the cut-over lands disposed of,”\\nand they created a financial deficit due from the federal\\nTreasury to Oregon counties. Clackamas, 219 F.2d at 487.\\nAccordingly, “[t]he purposes of the [1937] O & C act were\\ntwofold”: provide a “stream of revenue” to the affected\\ncounties and “halt [the] previous practices of clear-cutting\\nwithout reforestation.” Headwaters, 914 F.2d at 1183.\\nAlthough in Headwaters we rather cursorily addressed the\\npossibility of conservationist intent behind Congress’s\\nrejection of clear-cutting, id. at 1184, the historical record\\ncontains ample evidence of the government’s growing\\nenvironmental concern. Without doubt, Congress intended\\nto bestow significant discretion to the Department to manage\\nthe lands for posterity.\\n    The O&C Act Committee Reports from the House and\\nthe Senate convey a concern for conservation and an intent\\nto vest discretionary authority in the Department. H.R. Rep.\\n75-1119 (1937); S. Rep. No. 75-1231 (1937) (adopting the\\nHouse Report in full). The Reports frame the Act as a course\\ncorrection for the economic and environmental damage\\nwrought by the 1916 and 1926 Acts. These earlier statutes\\n“called for outright liquidation” of timber without making\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                   29\\n\\n\\nany provision “for the administration of the land on a\\nconservation basis looking toward the orderly use and\\npreservation of its natural resources.” H.R. Rep. 75-1119 at\\n2. By 1937, times had changed: such a policy of\\ndeforestation was “now believed to be wasteful and\\ndestructive of the best social interests of the State and\\nNation.” Id. at 2. Thus, Congress intended to set a\\nmaximum, not a minimum, quota for timber production, so\\nthat the O&C Lands’ natural assets could be “conserved and\\nperpetuated.” Id. at 2, 4. Such forward thinking drove the\\nstatute’s innovative adoption of “sustained yield” forestry,\\nsee id., and deference to the Department’s implementation\\nof that strategy. Heeding the concerns of the Department’s\\nActing Secretary, Congress sought to “provide conservation\\nand scientific management for this vast Federal property\\nwhich now receives no planned management.” Id. at 2; see\\nalso id. at 4–6 (reprinting in full a letter from the Acting\\nSecretary of the Interior).\\n    Placing the Committee Reports in their historical context\\nmakes Congress’s intent even clearer. The New Deal was\\nan era of agency expansion and pragmatic conservationism.\\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, “[q]uick exploitation of\\nthe natural resources” was the dominant ideology in the\\nWest, and the federal government struggled to intervene.\\nRoy E.

Dodds, The Oregon and California Lands: A Peculiar\\nHistory Produces Environmental Problems, 17 Env’t L. 739,\\n754 (1987).\\n   In an era of scarcity like the Great Depression, economic\\nand environmental preservation took on new urgency.\\n\f30                  MURPHY CO.

Meanwhile,\\nSecretary of the Interior Harold Ickes sought to rename his\\nagency as the “Department of Conservation” and double its\\nefforts to preserve natural resources and expand national\\nparks. Ickes Pushes New Department Unifying Federal\\nConservation, N.Y. Times, Nov. 22, 1937, at 1, 7. Such a\\nshift in thinking resonated at the local level as well: the\\nnorthwest regional head of the U.S. Forest Service warned\\nin 1934 that Oregon and Washington were facing a “day of\\nsocial and economic reckoning” if they did not change their\\ntimber practices. William G. Robbins, Timber Town:\\nMarket Economics in Coos Bay, Oregon, 1850 to the\\nPresent, 75 Pac. N.W. Q. 146, 152–53 (1984). The O&C\\nAct was designed to confront these contemporary challenges\\nand empower the Department to create a roadmap for the\\nfuture.\\n    Accordingly, in the decades to follow, the Department\\nimplemented an ever-evolving multiple use strategy for the\\nO&C Lands.         Especially since the expansion of\\nenvironmental legislation in the 1970s, the Department has\\nincreased protections for the Lands’ flora and fauna while\\ncontinuing to give credence to local communities’ reliance\\non timber production. See, e.g., Lyons, 871 F. Supp. at\\n1301–06, 1313–15 (summarizing the development and\\nlegislative backdrop of BLM resource management plans\\naffecting O&C Lands in the 1980s and 1990s).\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     31\\n\\n\\n       3. The Dissent Sidesteps the Fundamental\\n          Questions of Repeal and Inconsistency.\\n     The dissent’s concerns that Proclamation 9564 and the\\nO&C Act are in conflict are unsubstantiated. To begin, the\\ndissent misunderstands the powers granted to the President\\nwhen issuing proclamations pursuant to the Antiquities Act.\\nAs the Supreme Court has noted, “[t]he Antiquities Act of\\n1906 permits the President . . . to create a national\\nmonument and reserve for its use simply by issuing a\\nproclamation with respect to land owned or controlled by the\\nGovernment of the United States.” United States v.\\nCalifornia, 436 U.S. 32, 40 (1978) (emphasis added and\\ninternal citation omitted). This authority includes the power\\nto shift federal land from one federal use to another, id., with\\na concurrent shift in the laws and regulations governing its\\nuse. “Without such reservation, the federal lands would\\nremain subject to . . . continued federal management for [the\\npreviously] designated purposes.” Id. Put another way,\\ncontext is everything, and laws passed by Congress as to\\nhow federal lands should be treated in one context may not\\nfairly apply when the land is shifted to a different use having\\nits own set of rules.\\n    Applied here, this means that President Obama, through\\nhis expansion of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument,\\ndid no more and no less than take a small portion of the O&C\\nLands and direct the Secretary to manage the area for a new\\nuse. This would hardly be the first time a President has used\\nAntiquities Act authority to dedicate federal land for one use\\nthat Congress had previously appropriated for a different\\nuse. To take a recent example, President Obama in 2011\\nestablished the Fort Monroe National Monument,\\nProclamation 8750, 76 Fed. Reg. 68625 (Nov. 1, 2011),\\nnotwithstanding Congress’s delegation to the Secretary of\\n\f32                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nDefense of the exclusive authority to “utilize [and dispose\\nof] excess property . . . located” at the base after it was\\ndecommissioned as a military installation that same year, see\\n10 U.S.C. § 2687 note § 2905(b) (Defense Base Closure and\\nRealignment Act of 1990). Though it is plain that the\\nPresident’s designation made it impossible for the Secretary\\nof Defense to exercise this delegated authority, no one\\nviewed the President’s proclamation as somehow violative\\nof Congress’s previous authorization to the Secretary.\\n    Second, in the dissent’s view, such a reading of the\\nAntiquities Act would effectively allow the President to\\nrepeal any disagreeable statute. This, however, reduces\\nCongress to a bit player in federal land-management policy,\\nerasing the long history of vigorous action it has taken in\\nresponse to what it perceived to be presidential overreach.\\nWhen Congress has disagreed with a President’s decision to\\nexpand a monument or wanted to prevent the President from\\nexercising Antiquities Act powers in the first instance, it has\\nnot hesitated to make its disagreement known through\\nlegislative action. The earlier-discussed examples from\\nWyoming and Alaska affirmatively demonstrate\\ncongressional interplay with presidential authority under the\\nAntiquities Act. See Act of Sept. 14, 1950, Pub. L. No. 787,\\n§ 1, 64 Stat. 849, 849 (amending the Antiquities Act to\\nprohibit “further extension or establishment of national\\nparks or monuments in Wyoming” without congressional\\nauthorization following a dispute over the Jackson Hole\\nNational Monument); Act of Dec. 2, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-\\n487, § 1326(a), 94 Stat. 2371, 2488 (prohibiting future\\nExecutive Branch withdrawals of more than 5,000 acres of\\npublic lands within Alaska).\\n    We do not suggest that congressional silence is the\\nbellwether for interpretation. The important point is that the\\n\f                      MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     33\\n\\n\\ndesignation here is not contrary to the text of the O&C Act,\\nnor does it represent any effort to modify or nullify the Act.\\n     Finally, the dissent’s claim of executive nullification is\\nhyperbole. This is not a case where the executive’s action\\neviscerates Congress’s land-management scheme, nor is it a\\ncase that concerns “vast and amorphous expanses of terrain.”\\nMass. Lobstermen’s Ass’n, 141 S. Ct. at 981 (Roberts, C.J.,\\nstatement respecting the denial of certiorari). Of the more\\nthan two million acres of O&C Lands, only some 40,000\\nacres—less than two percent—fall within the expanded\\nMonument’s territory, and the Secretary retains broad\\ndiscretion over the millions of acres remaining. The\\nProclamation does not usurp congressional intent or the\\nSecretary’s broad authority to regulate the O&C Lands as a\\nwhole. If the dissent had its way, a President’s Antiquities\\nAct proclamation would be ultra vires whenever it arguably\\nimplicates some provision of a statute, no matter how minor\\nthe provision or how minimal the monument. Not only\\nwould such a rule be without precedent, but it could\\npotentially implicate many of the detailed land-management\\nstatutes throughout the United States Code. See, e.g., 43\\nU.S.C. §§ 1711–23, 1751–52, 1761–87 (sections featuring\\nspecific regulations on federal land). Most importantly, the\\ndissent’s theory sidesteps the foundational question of\\nwhether the O&C Act repealed the Antiquities Act in the\\nfirst place—it did not. Whatever the dissent’s concerns with\\nthe Antiquities Act writ large, this is not a case that tests the\\nbounds of the Act.\\nIII. CONCLUSION\\n   In short, the Proclamation is fully consistent with the\\nO&C Act, which governs a much larger swath of\\ntimberlands in Oregon and gives the Secretary discretion in\\n\f34                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nadministering those lands within the Act’s directives. We\\naffirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in\\nfavor of the United States and Soda Mountain.\\n     AFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\nTALLMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\\nin part:\\n\\n                              I\\n   I agree that we may review claims that the President’s\\nexecution of one statute obstructs the operation of another.\\nHowever, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s\\nconclusion that Proclamation 9564 does not conflict with the\\nOregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road\\nGrant Lands Act (O&C Act).\\n                              II\\n    This case arises from the protracted history of\\ncontroversial land use decisions that have decimated Pacific\\nNorthwest timber communities long dependent on logging\\nand wood product sales to sustain them. The management\\nof these vast swaths of federal land, removed from state and\\nlocal tax rolls, has had a checkered history to say the least,\\nbut also a devastating economic impact on these towns. The\\nPresident’s unilateral action here favoring environmental\\nconservation interests is the latest skirmish.\\n    Two small Oregon timber companies, Murphy Timber\\nCompany and Murphy Timber Investments, LLC\\n(collectively Murphy Co.) own land that is impacted by\\nadjacent federal timberland. In 1937 Congress enacted the\\nO&C Act and directed the Secretary of the Interior\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                   35\\n\\n\\n(Secretary) to manage those federal timberlands primarily\\nfor “permanent forest production . . . in conformity with the\\nprincipal [sic] of sustained yield.” 43 U.S.C. § 2601. In\\n2017 President Obama issued a proclamation pursuant to the\\nAntiquities Act which doubled the size of a preexisting\\nnational monument, created by President Clinton, to cover\\nO&C timberlands. Proclamation 9564, 82 Fed. Reg. 6145\\n(Jan. 12, 2017). The Proclamation directs the Secretary to\\nmanage lands “under the same laws and regulations that\\napply to the rest of the monument,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 6149,\\nwhich absolutely prohibit sustained yield calculation and\\n“[t]he commercial harvest of timber” within the monument.\\nProclamation 7318, 65 Fed. Reg. 37249, 37250 (June 9,\\n2000).\\n      The question we face is whether the President, through\\nan Antiquities Act proclamation, may direct a subordinate to\\ndisregard duties prescribed by another act of Congress. We\\nshould hold that “[t]he President cannot authorize a secretary\\n. . . to omit the performance of those duties which are\\nenjoined by law.” Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 138-39,\\n154, 158 (1803) (summarizing and endorsing arguments of\\ncounsel).\\n                             III\\n    The majority opens with a sterile analysis of whether the\\nO&C Act repealed the Antiquities Act. But whether the\\nAntiquities Act and the O&C Act can coexist in the abstract\\nis quite beside the point. Rather, we must decide whether\\nProclamation 9564—issued pursuant to the Antiquities\\nAct—conflicts with the O&C Act. Even a perfunctory\\nreview of the plain text of the Proclamation and the O&C\\nAct reveals an obvious conflict.\\n\f36                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\n    The Antiquities Act permits the President, in his\\n“discretion, [to] declare by public proclamation historic\\nlandmarks . . . situated on land owned or controlled by the\\nFederal Government to be national monuments.” 54 U.S.C.\\n§ 320301. The parcels of the monument that the President\\nmay reserve must “be confined to the smallest area\\ncompatible with the proper care and management of the\\nobjects to be protected.” Id.\\n    Enacted three decades after the Antiquities Act, the O&C\\nAct mandates that O&C timberlands “shall be managed” by\\nthe Secretary “for permanent forest production, and the\\ntimber thereon shall be sold, cut, and removed in conformity\\nwith the principal [sic] of sustained yield.” 43 U.S.C. § 2601\\n(emphasis added). In calculating sustained yield, the\\nSecretary must consider the following statutory goals:\\n“providing a permanent source of timber supply, protecting\\nwatersheds, regulating stream flow, and contributing to the\\neconomic stability of local communities and industries, and\\nproviding recreational facilties [sic].” Id. The O&C Act’s\\nnon-obstante clause, which the majority dismisses as too\\nvague to mean anything here, expressly provides: “All Acts\\nor parts of Acts in conflict with this Act are hereby repealed\\nto the extent necessary to give full force and effect to this\\nAct.” O&C Act, Pub. L. No. 75-405, § 5, 50 Stat. 874, 875\\n(1937).\\n    Proclamation 9564 doubles the existing Cascade-\\nSiskiyou National Monument to cover O&C timberlands,\\nand it directs the Secretary to manage those lands under\\n“laws and regulations,” 82 Fed. Reg. at 6149, that outright\\nprohibit “the commercial harvest of timber” and the\\n“calculation or provision of a sustained yield of timber” on\\nall lands falling within the monument. 65 Fed. Reg. at\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     37\\n\\n\\n37250. This removes the land entirely from inclusion as\\navailable timberlands to meet statutory commands.\\n    The conflict between the O&C Act and Proclamation\\n9564 could not be more self-evident. The O&C Act requires\\nsustained yield calculation for all O&C timberlands.\\nProclamation 9564 removes O&C timberlands from the\\nsustained yield calculation if they fall within the monument.\\nAlthough the Antiquities Act does grant the President broad\\nauthority to establish national monuments, nowhere does it\\nremotely purport to grant him authority to suspend the\\noperation of another act of Congress. By expressly singling\\nout sustained yield calculation for prohibition, the\\nPresident’s proclamation intentionally directs the Secretary\\nto disregard her statutory duties under the O&C Act to make\\nsure that timber is available for harvest to meet the economic\\nneeds of timber-dependent communities.\\n    The Secretary’s duty to conduct a sustained yield\\nanalysis for all O&C timberland “is not a proceeding which\\nmay be varied, if the judgment of the executive shall suggest\\none more eligible; but is a precise course accurately marked\\nout by law, and is to be strictly pursued.” Marbury, 5 U.S.\\nat 158. The Secretary must “conform to the law, and in this\\n[s]he is an officer of the United States, bound to obey the\\nlaws.” Id. She acts “under the authority of law, and not by\\nthe instructions of the President. It is a ministerial act which\\nthe law enjoins on a particular officer for a particular\\npurpose.” Id. And the President must “take Care that the\\nLaws be faithfully executed.” U.S. CONST. art II, § 3\\n(emphasis added).\\n    Accordingly, the “judicial inquiry is complete” and “our\\njob is at an end.” Connecticut Nat.’l Bank v. Germain, 503\\nU.S. 249, 254 (1992) (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449\\n\f38                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nU.S. 424, 430 (1981)); Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia,\\n140 S. Ct. 1731, 1749 (2020). We may not rewrite statutes\\nor executive orders to avoid clear conflict, and the only task\\nthat remains is to give effect to the plain meaning of the\\nO&C Act and declare the Proclamation void as to O&C\\ntimberland.\\n    Other principles of construction require us to give effect\\nto the O&C Act over Proclamation 9564. Under the canon\\nof generalia specialibus non derogant, “a ‘narrow, precise,\\nand specific’ statutory provision is not overridden by another\\nprovision ‘covering a more generalized spectrum’ of issues.”\\nPerez-Guzman v. Lynch, 835 F.3d 1066, 1075 (9th Cir.\\n2016) (quoting Radzanower v. Touche Ross & Co., 426 U.S.\\n148, 153-54 (1976)). We “assume Congress intended\\nspecific provisions to prevail over more general ones.” Id.\\nAs Judge Richard Leon correctly observed in American\\nForest Resource Council v. Hammond, “[t]he Antiquities\\nAct says nothing specific about managing O&C timberland.\\nAs such, it cannot be understood to nullify the timber harvest\\nmandates imposed by Congress in the O&C Act.” 422 F.\\nSupp. 3d 184, 193 (D.D.C. 2019) (citations omitted). An\\nexecutive proclamation issued pursuant to a general grant of\\nauthority cannot supersede a specific act of Congress.\\n     Furthermore, later-in-time statutes generally take\\npriority over earlier-enacted laws. See Bell v. United States,\\n366 U.S. 393, 407-08 (1961). The Antiquities Act, and any\\nexecution of it, must yield to the O&C Act because Congress\\nenacted the O&C Act intending that it have “full force and\\neffect” notwithstanding the existence of the Antiquities Act.\\nO&C Act, § 5, 50 Stat. 875. But where an act is both later\\nin time and more specific, the “specific policy embodied in\\na later federal statute should control our construction of the\\n[earlier] statute.” Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown &\\n\f                         MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                            39\\n\\n\\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 143 (2000)\\n(quoting United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517,\\n530 (1998)). 1 As the later-in-time statute specifically\\naddressing the management of O&C lands to provide\\nsustainable timber, the O&C Act supersedes the Antiquities\\nAct and any ensuing proclamation.\\n    The majority appears to have fashioned its own rule that\\nwhere Congress wishes to restrict the President’s Antiquities\\nAct authority, it must do so expressly. The majority cites\\ninstances where Congress has enacted legislation rebuking\\nexercises of the Antiquities Act in Wyoming and Alaska,\\nconcluding that “Congress would speak as clearly and\\npromptly here” if it felt the President had overstepped his\\nauthority. This argument belies foundational principles of\\nconstitutional law and misconstrues the role of courts in our\\ntripartite system of government.\\n    The Judiciary may not abdicate its duty to curtail\\nunlawful executive action merely because Congress may\\nalso act to restrain the President, THE FEDERALIST NO. 78\\n(Alexander Hamilton) (explaining constitutional limits “can\\nbe preserved in practice no other way than through the\\nmedium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare\\nall acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution\\nvoid”), and citizens need not await congressional action\\nbefore seeking relief from unlawful executive action in the\\ncourts. Id. (“There is no position which depends on clearer\\n\\n1\\n  For similar reasons, the majority’s reference to Congress’s vague\\ndelegation of authority to the Secretary of Defense to “utilize excess\\nproperty” at closed military bases is inapposite. 10 U.S.C. § 2687 note\\n§ 2905(b)(1)(A) (Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990).\\nSee also id. at § 2905(b)(1)(D) (also delegating authority to the Secretary\\nof Defense to “determine the availability of excess or surplus real\\nproperty for wildlife conservation purposes”).\\n\f40                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nprinciples, than that every act of a delegated authority,\\ncontrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is\\nexercised, is void. . . . To deny this, would be to\\naffirm . . . that the representatives of the people are superior\\nto the people themselves . . . .”).\\n    “The danger of imputing to Congress, as a result of its\\nfailure to take positive or affirmative action through normal\\nlegislative processes, ideas entertained by the [majority]\\nconcerning Congress’ will” is well known to courts.\\nCleveland v. United States, 329 U.S. 14, 23 (1946)\\n(Rutledge, J., concurring). “Congress cannot anticipate and\\nlegislate with regard to every possible action the President\\nmay find it necessary to take or every possible situation in\\nwhich he might act.” Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S.\\n654, 678 (1981). For those reasons, “[o]rdinarily, and quite\\nappropriately, courts are slow to attribute significance to the\\nfailure of Congress to act on particular legislation.” Bob\\nJones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600 (1983). And\\n“[u]nder      the    Youngstown       tripartite    framework,\\ncongressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President’s\\naction falls within the second category—that is, when he\\n‘acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of\\nauthority.’” Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 528 (2008)\\n(quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S.\\n579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). In other words,\\n“[a]n inference drawn from congressional silence certainly\\ncannot be credited when it is contrary to” the text of the O&C\\nAct. Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991).\\nMoreover, even an affirmative act of Congress cannot grant\\nthe President the power to indefinitely modify or nullify duly\\nenacted law. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417,\\n436-47 (1998). The majority’s deference to the political\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                     41\\n\\n\\nbranches of government in this case is contrary to our\\ncommitment to the rule of law.\\n    Indeed, the far-reaching implications of the majority’s\\ninterpretive rule are sobering: every federal land\\nmanagement law that does not expressly shield itself from\\nthe Antiquities Act is now subject to executive nullification\\nby proclamation. I can find no limiting principle within the\\nmajority opinion that counsels otherwise. I think it\\nmanifestly more sensible to apply a different presumption: I\\nwould not construe a statute to grant the President unfettered\\nauthority to indefinitely suspend or cancel the operation of\\nfederal law, see id. at 443-44 (distinguishing between\\nconstitutional delegations of authority to suspend statutes\\nand unconstitutional delegations of authority to cancel\\nstatutes), particularly where Congress has not expressly\\ndone so nor conditioned the suspension authority upon some\\nintelligible changed circumstance. See, e.g., 46 U.S.C. §\\n3101 (“When the President decides that the needs of foreign\\ncommerce require, the President may suspend a provision of\\nthis part . . . .” (emphasis added)); 46 U.S.C. § 60304 (“If the\\nPresident is satisfied that the government of a foreign\\ncountry does not impose discriminating or countervailing\\nduties to the disadvantage of the United States, the President\\nshall suspend the imposition of special tonnage taxes and\\nlight money . . . .” (emphasis added)); 22 U.S.C. § 4103\\n(“The President may by Executive order suspend any\\nprovision of this subchapter . . . if the President determines\\nin writing that the suspension is necessary in the interest of\\nnational security because of an emergency.” (emphasis\\nadded)).\\n    A few simple counterfactuals illustrate the infirmity of\\nthe majority’s position. As the majority notes, the year the\\nO&C Act was enacted, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\\n\f42                  MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\nexercised his Antiquities Act authority several times.\\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, President Roosevelt had\\nbeen opposed to logging and the O&C Act had been adopted\\nover his veto. According to the majority, President Roosevelt\\ncould have lawfully obstructed the clear will of Congress by\\nissuing an Antiquities Act proclamation prohibiting\\nsustained yield logging on some or all of the timberland the\\nvery next day.\\n    Suppose a President wishes to protect Crater Lake\\nNational Park from the harmful effects of park visitors.\\nUnder federal law, the “National Park shall be open, under\\nsuch regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may\\nprescribe, to all scientists, excursionists, and pleasure\\nseekers.” 16 U.S.C. § 123. According to the majority,\\nhowever, the President can prohibit visitors by issuing an\\nAntiquities Act proclamation reclassifying the park as a\\nnational monument. I cannot agree that Congress intended\\nto cede this unbridled power to the President when it enacted\\nthe Antiquities Act.\\n    By permitting Proclamation 9564 to supplant the O&C\\nAct, the majority has transmuted the Antiquities Act into a\\ncoiled timber rattler poised to strike at any land management\\nlaw that the President dislikes.\\n                             IV\\n    Notwithstanding the undeniable conflict between\\nProclamation 9564 and the O&C Act, the majority concludes\\nthey can be reconciled because the O&C Act “delegated\\nample discretion to the Department of the Interior to manage\\nthe lands in a flexible manner.” But it is unclear how the\\nmere grant of discretion as to how a sustained yield analysis\\nshould be conducted can justify the President’s total\\nprohibition on even engaging in a sustained yield analysis in\\n\f                     MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN                   43\\n\\n\\nthe first place by removing O&C timberlands from the\\ncalculation.\\n    The majority first argues that the O&C Act and the\\nProclamation are reconcilable because the Secretary has\\nunfettered discretion to classify or declassify O&C land as\\ntimberland. This proposition is dubious at best. First,\\ninterpreting the O&C Act to vest the Secretary with\\nunfettered discretion to declassify O&C timberland runs\\nafoul of the Constitution’s requirement that “an ‘intelligible\\nprinciple’ [must] guide the delegee’s exercise of authority.”\\nGundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019). Given\\nthe O&C Act incorporated O&C lands “heretofore” and\\n“hereafter” classified as timberlands, rather than grant the\\nSecretary unbounded discretion, it seems more likely that\\nCongress intended for the Secretary to classify O&C land\\nconsistent with past practice, meaning “lands bearing a\\ngrowth of timber not less than three hundred thousand”\\nboard feet per 40 acres. Chamberlain-Ferris Act, Pub. L. No.\\n86, ch. 137, § 2, 39 Stat. 218, 219 (1916); see also Bilski v.\\nKappos, 561 U.S. 593, 647 (2010) (explaining “an ambiguity\\nin a later-in-time statute must be understood in light of the\\nearlier-in-time framework against which the ambiguous\\nstatute was passed”).\\n    Second, even assuming the Secretary possesses fiat\\nauthority to declassify the O&C timberlands at issue, the\\ngovernment has not directed us to a rulemaking by the\\nSecretary actually doing so. Since Murphy Co. has made\\nclear that its suit pertains only to O&C lands that the\\nSecretary has heretofore classified as timberlands, the\\nSecretary’s supposed authority remains unexercised and is\\ntherefore irrelevant to this appeal.\\n\f44                   MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN\\n\\n\\n    Although conceding that the dominant use for O&C\\ntimberlands is timber production to sustain struggling timber\\ncommunities, the majority next argues that the Proclamation\\nis justified because the Secretary has discretion to consider\\nthe additional goals of “protecting watersheds, regulating\\nstream flow, and contributing to the economic stability of\\nlocal communities and industries, and providing recreational\\nfacil[i]ties” when conducting a sustained yield analysis. 43\\nU.S.C. § 2601. But Proclamation 9564 is not an exercise of\\nthe Secretary’s discretion; it is a presidential command. The\\ncommand does not itself direct the Secretary to exercise her\\ndiscretion in a certain manner, but rather it restricts her from\\nexercising any discretion at all by prohibiting sustained yield\\nanalysis within the monument. It preordains a result and\\ndirects the Secretary, for all time, to prohibit commercial\\nlogging on the relevant O&C timberlands regardless of\\nchanging conditions on the ground. The mere fact that the\\nSecretary could effectuate a similar outcome if given the\\nfreedom to exercise her statutorily mandated O&C Act\\ndiscretion is insufficient to rescue the President’s unlawful\\ncommand.\\n                               V\\n    Conservation is a noble goal, and national monuments\\nhave undoubtedly preserved and proliferated the richness of\\nthe American landscape. But the unfortunate back-end cost\\nof conservation is that small, local communities reliant on\\nthe cultivation of natural resources to generate revenue to\\nsustain them are often left behind.

The decision today continues a troubling trend of\\nincreased judicial deference to Presidential uses of the\\nAntiquities Act.

A statute permitting the\\n        President in his sole discretion to designate as\\n        monuments “landmarks,” “structures,” and\\n        “objects”—along with the smallest area of\\n        land compatible with their management—has\\n        been transformed into a power without any\\n        discernible limit to set aside vast and\\n        amorphous expanses of terrain above and\\n        below the sea.\\n\\nMassachusetts Lobstermen’s Ass’n v.

But the government insisted that the Proclamation\\nwas lawful because the adverse effect on the O&C Act was\\nminimal.

But the\\nConstitution enshrines our fundamental understanding that\\nthe separation of powers is an “essential precaution in favor\\nof liberty.” THE FEDERALIST NO. 47 (James Madison).

Only Congress may do this.\\n    Proclamations and executive orders of this reach are\\noften responsive to criticisms by advocates that Congress is\\ntoo formalistic and inflexible in performing its legislative\\nfunction as originally envisioned by the Framers in today’s\\ndynamic world. The legislative process can sometimes be\\nslow and frustrating, but the procedural strictures enshrined\\nin our Constitution are unyielding because they exist to\\nmaintain our Republic’s status as a government of laws and\\nnot of men.

Background\\n\\n      A.    Factual\\n\\n      For the purposes of resolving CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, the\\n\\nCourt assumes the facts alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint\\n\\nto be true and construes them in Ms. Pool’s favor. See Baird v.\\n\\nGotbaum, 792 F.3d 166, 169 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n                                2\\n\f     In 2007, CNA arranged for Ms. Pool to provide daily nursing\\n\\nservices in South Africa to Daniel Brink (“Mr. Brink”), a\\n\\ncontractor who had sustained several injuries from an explosion\\n\\nin Iraq. See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 86–87. Ms. Pool submitted a\\n\\nseries of invoices to CNA seeking payment for her services and\\n\\nreimbursement for other services and supplies. See id. ¶ 88. CNA\\n\\ninitially paid some invoices but at some point, stopped. See id.\\n\\n¶ 89. Because she had not been reimbursed for services and\\n\\nsupplies, medical companies and service providers later brought\\n\\ncollections actions totaling over $150,000 against Ms. Pool and\\n\\nher company, Guardian Medical. See id. ¶¶ 90–91.\\n\\n     On September 26, 2011, Ms. Pool and other plaintiffs\\n\\n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this class action against\\n\\nvarious government contractors and their insurance carriers. See\\n\\nCompl., ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 453–64.

Objections to a Magistrate Judge’s Report and\\n          Recommendation\\n\\n     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b), a party\\n\\nmay file specific written objections once a magistrate judge has\\n\\nentered a recommended disposition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1)-(2).\\n\\nA district court “may accept, reject, or modify the recommended\\n\\ndisposition.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); see also 28 U.S.C. §\\n\\n636(b)(1)(C) (“A judge of the court may accept, reject, or\\n\\nmodify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations\\n\\nmade by the magistrate judge.”). A district court “must\\n\\ndetermine de novo any part of the magistrate judge’s disposition\\n\\nthat has been properly objected to.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).\\n\\n“If, however, the party makes only conclusory or general\\n\\nobjections, or simply reiterates his original arguments, the\\n\\n\\n                               5\\n\fCourt reviews the [R. &amp; R.] only for clear error.” Houlahan v.\\n\\nBrown, 979 F. Supp. 2d 86, 88 (D.D.C. 2013) (citation and\\n\\ninternal quotation marks omitted). “Under the clearly erroneous\\n\\nstandard, the magistrate judge’s decision is entitled to great\\n\\ndeference” and “is clearly erroneous only if on the entire\\n\\nevidence the court is left with the definite and firm conviction\\n\\nthat a mistake has been committed.” Buie v. Dist. of Columbia,\\n\\nNo. CV 16-1920 (CKK), 2019 WL 4345712, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 12,\\n\\n2019) (citing Graham v. Mukasey, 608 F. Supp. 2d 50, 52 (D.D.C.\\n\\n2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n     Objections must “specifically identify the portions of the\\n\\nproposed findings and recommendations to which objection is made\\n\\nand the basis for the objection[s].” LCvR 72.3(b). “[O]bjections\\n\\nwhich merely rehash an argument presented and considered by the\\n\\nmagistrate judge are not ‘properly objected to’ and are\\n\\ntherefore not entitled to de novo review.” Shurtleff v.

Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for\\n\\ndismissal of an action for “lack of subject matter\\n\\njurisdiction.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On a Rule 12(b)(1)\\n\\nmotion to dismiss, the party asserting jurisdiction has the\\n\\nburden of establishing that the Court has subject matter\\n\\n                               6\\n\fjurisdiction over the case. See Logan v. Dep’t of Veterans\\n\\nAffs., 357 F. Supp. 2d 149, 153 (D.D.C. 2004) (citing McNutt v.\\n\\nGen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182–83,\\n\\n(1936)). “Because Rule 12(b)(1) concerns a court’s ability to\\n\\nhear a particular claim, the court must scrutinize the [party]’s\\n\\nallegations more closely when considering a motion to dismiss\\n\\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) than it would under a motion to\\n\\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Schmidt v. U.S. Capitol\\n\\nPolice Bd., 826 F. Supp. 2d 59, 65 (D.D.C. 2011) (citations\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     To assess whether a complaint sufficiently alleges subject\\n\\nmatter jurisdiction, the Court accepts as true the allegations\\n\\nof the complaint, see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\\n\\n(2009); and liberally construes the pleadings in the plaintiff’s\\n\\nfavor, see Barr v. Clinton, 370 F.3d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir.\\n\\n2004). The Court may also consider “undisputed facts evidenced\\n\\nin the record” as well as its own “resolution of disputed\\n\\nfacts.” Herbert v. Nat’l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C.\\n\\nCir. 1992).\\n\\n     C.     Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\\n\\n     A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\\n\\nProcedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint.\\n\\nBrowning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). A\\n\\ncomplaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim\\n\\n                                 7\\n\fshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give\\n\\nthe defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the\\n\\ngrounds upon which it rests.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\\n\\nU.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks\\n\\nomitted).\\n\\n     Despite this liberal pleading standard, to survive a motion\\n\\nto dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter,\\n\\naccepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible\\n\\non its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citation and internal\\n\\nquotation marks omitted). “In determining whether a complaint\\n\\nfails to state a claim, [the court] may consider only the facts\\n\\nalleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or\\n\\nincorporated in the complaint and matters of which [the court]\\n\\nmay take judicial notice.” EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial\\n\\nSch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997). A claim is facially\\n\\nplausible when the facts pled in the complaint allow the court\\n\\nto “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\\n\\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. The\\n\\nstandard does not amount to a “probability requirement,” but it\\n\\ndoes require more than a “sheer possibility that a defendant has\\n\\nacted unlawfully.” Id.\\n\\n     “[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss [pursuant\\n\\nto Rule 12(b)(6)], a judge must accept as true all of the\\n\\nfactual allegations contained in the complaint.” Atherton v.\\n\\n                               8\\n\fD.C. Off. of the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\\n\\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition,\\n\\nthe court must give the plaintiff the “benefit of all inferences\\n\\nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.” Kowal v. MCI\\n\\nCommc’ns Corp., 16 F.3d 1271, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\\n\\nIV.   Analysis\\n\\n      A.   The Court Has Diversity Jurisdiction Over Ms. Pool’s\\n           Claims\\n\\n      The Fourth Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges diversity of\\n\\ncitizenship as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction. See FAC,\\n\\nECF No. 214 ¶ 3. Magistrate Judge Faruqui concluded that Ms.\\n\\nPool failed to establish diversity jurisdiction because she\\n\\nprovided no facts to support her legal conclusion that “there is\\n\\ncomplete diversity of citizenship of the parties.” R. &amp;. R., ECF\\n\\nNo. 248 at 4-5. Ms. Pool did not object to Magistrate Judge\\n\\nFaruqui’s conclusion in her objections to the R. &amp;. R., see\\n\\ngenerally Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1; but did argue in her\\n\\nresponse to CNA’s objections that CNA incorrectly argued that\\n\\nthere is no diversity jurisdiction, arguing that the FAC alleges\\n\\ncomplete diversity of citizenship as to herself and CNA, Pl.’s\\n\\nOpp’n, ECF No. 253 at 15-16.\\n\\n      The Court has an “affirmative obligation to determine\\n\\nwhether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the action.”\\n\\nFriends Christian High Sch. v. Geneva Fin. Consultants, 321\\n\\n\\n                                9\\n\fF.R.D. 20, 22 (D.D.C. 2017). Diversity jurisdiction exists when\\n\\nthe action involves citizens of different states, and the amount\\n\\nin controversy exceeds $75,000.00 per plaintiff, exclusive of\\n\\ninterest and costs. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a). Each plaintiff must be\\n\\ndiverse from each defendant for diversity jurisdiction to exist.\\n\\nSee In re Lorazepam &amp; Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 631 F.3d\\n\\n537, 541 (D.C. Cir. 2011). “[T]he party seeking the exercise of\\n\\ndiversity jurisdiction bears the burden of pleading the\\n\\ncitizenship of each and every party to the action.” Naartex\\n\\nConsulting Corp. v. Watt, 722 F.2d 779, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1983). At\\n\\nthis time, the only parties that remain in this action are Ms.\\n\\nPool and CNA. Accordingly, Ms. Pool needs to allege complete\\n\\ndiversity between herself and CNA. For the reasons explained\\n\\nbelow and liberally construing the pleadings in her favor, the\\n\\nCourt concludes that Ms. Pool has adequately alleged diversity\\n\\njurisdiction.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool alleges that she is a foreign national of South\\n\\nAfrica. The FAC alleges that “[o]ne of the Plaintiffs described\\n\\nbelow is a foreign national from South Africa who was denied pay\\n\\nunder an agreement with Continental Insurance Company that\\n\\ncaused loss to her and her business as described below.” FAC,\\n\\nECF No. 214 ¶ 5. The only Plaintiff who alleges that she was\\n\\ndenied pay under an agreement with CNA is Ms. Pool. See id. ¶¶\\n\\n153-167.\\n\\n                               10\\n\f     “[A] corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every\\n\\nState and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of\\n\\nthe State or foreign state where it has its principal place of\\n\\nbusiness.” 28 U.S.C. § 1332(c)(1). The FAC alleges that CNA’s\\n\\nheadquarters is in Chicago, Illinois. See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶ 93.\\n\\nWith these allegations, Ms. Pool has adequately alleged complete\\n\\ndiversity between herself and CNA because she has alleged that\\n\\nshe is a citizen of South Africa and that CNA is a citizen of\\n\\nIllinois. Ms. Pool also alleges damages in excess of $200,000.\\n\\nId. ¶ 97, 156. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Ms.\\n\\nPool has adequately alleged diversity jurisdiction.\\n\\n     The FAC does not allege that the Court has supplemental\\n\\njurisdiction over Ms. Pool’s claims against CNA. Ms. Pool\\n\\nalleges claims for breach of contract, see id. ¶¶ 153-164; and\\n\\ntortious breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, see\\n\\nid. ¶¶ 165-168. However, the FAC alleges only that “[t]he court\\n\\nhas supplemental jurisdiction over the federal common law or\\n\\nstate law claims for fraud, bad faith insurance practices,\\n\\noutrage, and deception in trade practices.” Id. ¶ 3. Because the\\n\\nCourt has determined that it has diversity jurisdiction over Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims, however, the Court need not address the parties’\\n\\narguments regarding supplemental jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               11\\n\f     B.   The Court Adopts the Portion of the R. &amp; R. Regarding\\n          the Statute of Limitations\\n\\n     Both parties object to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nconclusions as to whether the statute of limitations bars Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims. For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees\\n\\nwith Magistrate Judge Faruqui that Ms. Pool’s invoices from June\\n\\n30, 2008 to October 30, 2009 fall within the statute of\\n\\nlimitations and that her invoices preceding that period are\\n\\nbarred.\\n\\n          1.   Ms. Pool’s Claims Relate Back to the Original\\n               Complaint\\n\\n     CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that\\n\\nMs. Pool’s claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint relate back to\\n\\nthe original Complaint. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-20.\\n\\n     An amended complaint “relates back to the date of the\\n\\noriginal pleading when[] . . . the amendment asserts a claim or\\n\\ndefense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or\\n\\noccurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original\\n\\npleading.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). To determine whether the\\n\\namendment relates back, the court inquires “whether the original\\n\\ncomplaint adequately notified the defendant[] of the basis for\\n\\nliability the plaintiff[] would later advance in the amended\\n\\ncomplaint.” Meijer, Inc. v. Biovail Corp., 533 F.3d 857, 866\\n\\n(D.C. Cir. 2008).\\n\\n\\n\\n                               12\\n\f     CNA asserts that Magistrate Judge Faruqui erred for two\\n\\nreasons. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-20. First, CNA\\n\\ncontends that Magistrate Judge Faruqui failed to consider that\\n\\n“a new claim cannot relate back to claims that were eliminated\\n\\nfrom the prior complaint.” Id. at 18 (citing Halldorson v. Sandi\\n\\nGrp., 934 F. Supp. 2d 147, 158 (D.D.C. 2013); Wagner v.\\n\\nGeorgetown Univ. Med. Ctr., 768 A.2d 546, 559 (D.C. 2001)).\\n\\nSecond, CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui erroneously\\n\\nlimited his inquiry to whether CNA was on notice of Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nclaims and “did not undertake the necessary analysis of whether\\n\\n[Ms.] Pool’s new individual claim for breach of contract arises\\n\\nfrom the ‘same conduct’ that forms the basis of” the claims that\\n\\nremain in the case. Id. at 19 (citations omitted). Here, CNA\\n\\nconcludes that Ms. Pool’s claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint\\n\\ncannot relate back to the claims in the original Complaint\\n\\nbecause: the Court dismissed the Second Amended Complaint “in\\n\\nits entirety”; the only claims that remain now are the ADA\\n\\nclaims by other plaintiffs in the case; and the ADA claims do\\n\\nnot pertain to Mr. Brink, Ms. Pool, or CNA. Id.\\n\\n     As to CNA’s first point, Ms. Pool argues that CNA has\\n\\nmisinterpreted the caselaw and that the caselaw limits relation\\n\\nback only when the older claim was voluntarily dismissed. See\\n\\nPl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 14 (citing Halldorson, 934 F.2 at\\n\\n158). The Court agrees with Ms. Pool that the caselaw does not\\n\\n                               13\\n\fsupport CNA’s position. In Halldorson, the Court held that the\\n\\nstate-law retaliation claims in the third amended complaint did\\n\\nnot relate back to previous allegations because the second\\n\\namended complaint “eliminated” the state-law retaliation claims\\n\\nand the settlement agreement preceding the second amended\\n\\ncomplaint otherwise barred common-law theories of recovery.\\n\\nHalldorson, 934 F.2 at 158. Here, by contrast, previous\\n\\nlitigation “eliminated” only the class claims alleged by Ms.\\n\\nPool and other plaintiffs against CNA and other defendants but\\n\\n“d[id] not preclude separate proceedings for . . . [Ms.] Pool to\\n\\nallege [an individual claim for] breach of contract” against\\n\\nCNA. Brink, 787 F.3d at 1126. Halldorson is therefore\\n\\ndistinguishable from the instant case.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool does not address CNA’s second point that\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui failed to consider whether her new\\n\\nclaim arose from the same conduct as the original claim. See\\n\\nPl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 12-14. She instead defends\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that CNA had notice of Ms.\\n\\nPool’s claims, see id.; an issue that CNA does not dispute in\\n\\nits Objections, see generally Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 18-\\n\\n20. Despite her silence, the Court is persuaded that Magistrate\\n\\nJudge Faruqui undertook the necessary Rule 15 analysis here.\\n\\n“[B]oth elements [of Rule 15]—same conduct and adequate notice—\\n\\nmust be satisfied before relation back of new claims is\\n\\n                               14\\n\fpermitted.” Constr. Interior Sys., Inc., 813 F. Supp. at 37. The\\n\\ndistrict court there held that the new claim did not relate back\\n\\nto the original pleadings in part because the “factual\\n\\nunderpinnings” of the new claim were “entirely different” from\\n\\nthose in the original complaint. Id. at 36-37. Here, as\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui explained in the R. &amp; R., see R. &amp; R.,\\n\\nECF No. 248 at 6; the factual underpinnings of Ms. Pool’s new\\n\\nclaims are the same as those of her previous class claim,\\n\\ncompare FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 86-97, with Compl., ECF No. 1 ¶¶\\n\\n453-64. Stated differently, the new individual claim arose from\\n\\nthe same conduct as the original pleading. See United States v.\\n\\nHicks, 283 F.3d 380, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\\n\\n     Finally, CNA argues that Ms. Pool’s claims do not relate\\n\\nback because the D.C. Circuit “did not remand the case with\\n\\ndirections to allow amending the complaint to include Pool’s\\n\\nindividual claims.” Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 20. This\\n\\nargument ignores, however, that the D.C. Circuit did not\\n\\nprohibit Ms. Pool from seeking leave to amend the complaint to\\n\\nallege individual claims. Cf. Brink, 787 F.3d at 1126\\n\\n(explaining that the decision “does not preclude separate\\n\\nproceedings for . . . [Ms.] Pool to allege a breach of\\n\\ncontract”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) (“The court should freely\\n\\ngive leave [to amend the complaint] when justice so requires.”).\\n\\n\\n\\n                               15\\n\f      Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool’s individual\\n\\nclaims relate back to the original Complaint and ADOPTS that\\n\\nportion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n           2.   Magistrate Judge Faruqui Correctly Assumed an\\n                Installment Contract with a Three-month Payment\\n                Term\\n\\n      Both parties object to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s analysis\\n\\nand conclusion as to when Ms. Pool’s claims accrued. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12; Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 20-\\n\\n21.\\n\\n      CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui incorrectly\\n\\nassumed the existence of an installment contract. Def.’s Objs.,\\n\\nECF No. 252 at 20. CNA asserts that this assumption is erroneous\\n\\nbecause it is based on information in Ms. Pool’s Opposition to\\n\\nCNA’s Motion to Dismiss and not any allegations in the FAC. See\\n\\nid. (citing Afram v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Unions &amp;\\n\\nParticipating Emp’rs Health &amp; Welfare Fund, 958 F. Supp. 2d 275,\\n\\n279 n.1 (D.D.C. 2013), appeal dismissed, No. 13–7136, 2014 WL\\n\\n1378304 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 21, 2014); Briscoe v. Costco Wholesale\\n\\nCorp., 61 F. Supp. 3d 78, 83 n.2 (D.D.C. 2014)). Ms. Pool does\\n\\nnot respond to this objection. See generally Pl.’s Objs., ECF\\n\\nNo. 250-1; Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253; Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 256.\\n\\n      The Court is not persuaded that Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nerred by considering the exhibits Ms. Pool filed with her\\n\\nOpposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss. Although a court may not\\n\\n                                16\\n\fconsider new allegations raised in response to a motion to\\n\\ndismiss, see Briscoe, 61 F. Supp. 3d at 83 n. 2 (citing Sloan v.\\n\\nUrban Title Servs., Inc., 689 F. Supp. 2d 94, 114 (D.D.C.\\n\\n2010)); it also “may consider . . . any documents either\\n\\nattached to or incorporated in the complaint,” EEOC, 117 F.3d at\\n\\n624. Here, the FAC discusses the “regular invoices [Ms. Pool\\n\\nsent to CNA] for services she provided, and for the services,\\n\\nsupplies and medical providers whom she engaged to care for Mr.\\n\\nBrink’s various needs from hospitalizations, wound care,\\n\\noperations, therapy, and transportation and medical supplies” as\\n\\nwell as CNA’s payment of   “some of those invoices.” FAC, ECF No.\\n\\n214 ¶¶ 88-89. Because the FAC incorporates those invoices and\\n\\npayment records by reference, Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nappropriately considered Ms. Pool’s exhibits. See Gerlich v.\\n\\nU.S. Dep’t of Just., 659 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009).\\n\\n     In the alternative, CNA contends that Magistrate Judge\\n\\nFaruqui did not imply a reasonable time for performance under an\\n\\ninstallment contract. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 21.\\n\\nSpecifically, CNA argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui “erred in\\n\\ndisregarding [Ms.] Pool’s own declaration, which concedes that\\n\\n‘CNA stopped paying invoices in 2007.’” Id. (quoting Pool Decl.,\\n\\nECF No. 227-2 ¶ 8). The Court disagrees with this assessment. In\\n\\nher declaration, Ms. Pool references documentation of CNA’s\\n\\npayment history. See Pool Decl., ECF No. 227-2 ¶ 8 (“attached\\n\\n                                17\\n\fspread sheet, attachment 3 hereto, showing invoicing and\\n\\npayments with interest, to today’s date that have been\\n\\nincurred”). In that exhibit, Ms. Pool states that CNA paid her\\n\\nin three-month intervals. See Ex. 3, ECF No. 227-2 at 21-22. The\\n\\nCourt therefore concludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui fairly\\n\\nimplied a three-month payment term. See R. &amp; R., ECF No. 248 at\\n\\n8 (discussing Exhibit 3).\\n\\n     Ms. Pool also objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nanalysis as to whether CNA repudiated the contract. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12. However, as CNA states in its\\n\\nOpposition, see Def.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 255 at 9; her objection\\n\\nmerely repeats her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss\\n\\nverbatim, compare Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 7-12, with Pl.’s\\n\\nOpp’n &amp; Resp. Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No.\\n\\n227 at 15-19. Accordingly, the Court reviews this objection only\\n\\nfor clear error, see Houlahan, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 88; and\\n\\nconcludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui did not err with respect\\n\\nto his analysis in this portion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n     In sum, the Court concludes that Magistrate Judge Faruqui\\n\\nappropriately assumed the existence of an installment contract\\n\\nand implied a three-month payment term.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                               18\\n\f          3.   Magistrate Judge Faruqui Correctly Disregarded\\n               Ms. Pool’s Equitable Tolling Arguments\\n\\n     Ms. Pool objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s failure to\\n\\napply the doctrine of equitable tolling to her claims. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 12-15. As with her repudiation argument,\\n\\nsee supra, her objection largely restates her Opposition to\\n\\nCNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare id., with Pl.’s Opp’n\\n\\n&amp; Resp. Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 227\\n\\nat 20-23. The Court therefore reviews Ms. Pool’s objection only\\n\\nfor clear error. See Houlahan, 979 F. Supp. 2d at 88. Finding no\\n\\nerror, the Court ADOPTS the portion of the R. &amp; R. pertaining to\\n\\nthe statute of limitations.\\n\\n     C.   Ms. Pool Adequately Pleaded a Claim for Breach of\\n          Contract\\n\\n     CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s conclusion that\\n\\nMs. Pool adequately pleaded her claim for breach of contract.\\n\\nSee Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 21-25. In particular, CNA\\n\\nargues that: (1) Magistrate Judge Faruqui incorrectly considered\\n\\nevidence Ms. Pool submitted with her Opposition to its Motion to\\n\\nDismiss; (2) Ms. Pool has not alleged the existence of a\\n\\ncontract; and (3) Magistrate Judge Faruqui erred by not\\n\\nconsidering its documentary evidence. See id. For the reasons\\n\\nthat follow, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool has properly\\n\\npleaded her breach of contract claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n                               19\\n\f     CNA first contends that the Court should reject Magistrate\\n\\nJudge Faruqui’s recommendation because it “is based, in large\\n\\npart, on new allegations and documentation proffered by [Ms.]\\n\\nPool in her opposition.” Id. at 21. As the Court explained\\n\\nsupra, it was appropriate for Magistrate Judge Faruqui to\\n\\nconsider Ms. Pool’s exhibits because they are incorporated into\\n\\nthe FAC by reference. See EEOC, 117 F.3d at 624.\\n\\n     CNA next argues that Magistrate Judge Faruqui should have\\n\\nrecommended dismissal because Ms. Pool has not alleged the\\n\\nexistence of a contract. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 22-24.\\n\\nIndeed, a plaintiff alleging a breach of contract must plead,\\n\\ninter alia, a valid contract between the parties. Tsintolas\\n\\nRealty Co. v. Mendez, 984 A.2d 181, 187 (D.C. 2009). Looking\\n\\nonly at the FAC and not the documents incorporated by reference,\\n\\nCNA argues that Ms. Pool has failed to allege material terms of\\n\\na contract, including: whether Ms. Pool had a contract, when the\\n\\ncontract was executed, when Ms. Pool submitted invoices, the\\n\\ndetails of her invoices, or the payment terms. See Def.’s Objs.,\\n\\nECF No. 252 at 22-23. CNA further contends that Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nallegations in the FAC suggest only: that CNA had a contractual\\n\\nrelationship with other entities; and that Ms. Pool had a\\n\\nrelationship with Mr. Brink. See id. at 23-24.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool counters that she has alleged the existence of a\\n\\ncontract. See Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 253 at 16-18. Citing the FAC,\\n\\n                               20\\n\fshe argues that she alleged: “[t]here was an agreement, CNA\\n\\nacted as if there was, [she] performed services in reliance on\\n\\nsuch, [and] CNA paid for some of the invoices (accounts\\n\\nstated).” Id. at 18. The Court agrees that Ms. Pool has\\n\\n“sufficiently allege[d] the existence of a contract, its general\\n\\nterms, and the contractual obligation that [CNA] purportedly\\n\\nviolated (i.e. failing to pay [her]).” Burnett v. Am. Fed’n of\\n\\nGov’t Emps., 102 F. Supp. 3d 183, 193 (D.D.C. 2015) (explaining\\n\\nthat “[w]hen those elements are pled, . . . courts have held\\n\\nthat plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim, despite the\\n\\notherwise imprecise or vague nature of the complaint”). In the\\n\\nFAC, she alleges an agreement—for her “to perform nursing\\n\\nservices and nurse case management services for [CNA]” and for\\n\\nCNA “to pay her for her services.” FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 154-55.\\n\\nShe also alleges the terms of the contract by describing how\\n\\nboth parties performed pursuant to that agreement. See id. ¶¶\\n\\n156-59 (describing the services Ms. Pool was bound to provide\\n\\nand the payments CNA was bound to make). The Court concludes\\n\\nbased on these allegations that Ms. Pool has adequately pleaded\\n\\nthe existence of a contract. See Burnett, 102 F. Supp. 3d at\\n\\n192-93.\\n\\n     Finally, CNA objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s failure\\n\\nto consider the settlement agreement it entered into with Mr.\\n\\nBrink. See Def.’s Objs., ECF No. 252 at 24-25. The Court agrees\\n\\n                               21\\n\fwith CNA that it may take judicial notice of this record. See\\n\\nVenable LLP v. Overseas Lease Grp., Inc., No. CV 14-02010 (RJL),\\n\\n2015 WL 4555372, at *3 n.7 (D.D.C. July 28, 2015) (taking\\n\\njudicial notice of a settlement agreement in the public record).\\n\\nHowever, this settlement agreement does not alter the Court’s\\n\\nanalysis because, as with its briefing on its Motion to Dismiss,\\n\\nCNA cites no legal authority to explain why Ms. Pool is bound by\\n\\nits agreement with Mr. Brink. See generally Def.’s Objs., ECF\\n\\nNo. 252 at 24-25.\\n\\n     Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. Pool has stated a\\n\\nclaim for breach of contract and ADOPTS this portion of the R. &amp;\\n\\nR.\\n\\n     D.   Ms. Pool Has Not Pleaded a Claim for Breach of the\\n          Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\\n\\n     Finally, Ms. Pool objects to Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s\\n\\nconclusion that she has not pleaded a claim for breach of the\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See Pl.’s\\n\\nObjs., ECF No. 250-1 at 15-18.\\n\\n     Under District of Columbia law, all contracts contain an\\n\\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Nugent v. Unum\\n\\nLife Ins. Co. of Am., 752 F.Supp.2d 46, 56 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing\\n\\nAllworth v. Howard Univ., 890 A.2d 194, 201 (D.C. 2006)). A\\n\\nplaintiff alleging a claim for a breach of this implied covenant\\n\\n“must allege either bad faith or conduct that is arbitrary and\\n\\n\\n                                 22\\n\fcapricious.” Wright v. Howard Univ., 60 A.3d 749, 754 (D.C.\\n\\n2013). “Bad faith requires more than mere negligence,” such as\\n\\n“lack of diligence, purposeful failure to perform, and\\n\\ninterference with the other party’s ability to perform.” Id.\\n\\n     Ms. Pool argues that CNA’s actions “were malicious and\\n\\nintended to deceive and deprive [her] of” payment for the\\n\\nservices she rendered. See Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 16.\\n\\nCiting the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, she contends that\\n\\nthe following constitutes bad faith: evasion; agreement and\\n\\nsubsequent refusal to meet; delay of payment; and refusal to\\n\\nnegotiate with her attorney. See id. at 17.\\n\\n     CNA defends Magistrate Judge Faruqui’s determination that\\n\\nMs. Pool’s allegations are vague, conclusory, and otherwise\\n\\nduplicative of her breach of contract claim. See Def.’s Opp’n,\\n\\nECF No. 255 at 13-15. The Court agrees with CNA. Ms. Pool’s\\n\\nallegations of “evasion” and “refusal” are vague and conclusory.\\n\\nSee Ruiz v. Millennium Square Residential Ass’n, No. 1:19-cv-\\n\\n3765, 2022 WL 296200, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 1, 2022), appeal\\n\\ndocketed, No. 22-7024 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2022). Other\\n\\nallegations merely repeat the allegations she made in connection\\n\\nwith her breach of contract claim. See generally FAC, ECF No.\\n\\n214. The Court therefore is persuaded that Ms. Pool has failed\\n\\nto state a claim for a breach of the implied covenant of good\\n\\nfaith and fair dealing and ADOPTS this portion of the R. &amp; R.\\n\\n                               23\\n\fV.   Conclusion\\n\\n     For the foregoing reasons, the Court ADOPTS IN PART\\n\\nMagistrate Judge Faruqui’s R. &amp; R., ECF No. 248; and GRANTS IN\\n\\nPART and DENIES IN PART CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 220.

Defendant was 16 years old when he was arrested on charges of\\n\\nAttempted Murder First Degree, Robbery First Degree, Conspiracy Second Degree,\\n\\nand two firearm charges. Extensive negotiations yielded a plea agreement. On April\\n\\n22, 2015, Defendant pled guilty to one count of the Lesser Included Offense of the\\n\\nmurder charge to Assault First Degree, one count of Robbery First Degree, and two\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                           1\\n\fcounts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony (PFDCF).1\\n\\nDefendant was immediately sentenced—upon a joint recommendation by both the\\n\\nState and him—to nineteen years, with eleven to be served as a minimum mandatory\\n\\nperiod of incarceration. 2\\n\\n       2.     On April 27, 2020, Defendant filed his first Motion for Modification\\n\\nunder Rule 35(b).3 That motion was denied. 4 On February 4, 2021, Defendant filed\\n\\na Motion for Modification of Sentence for an Offense Committed as a Juvenile,5\\n\\nwhich was summarily dismissed.6\\n\\n       3.     Defendant now moves again under Rule 35, seeking that his Level V\\n\\nsentence be reduced to facilitate his cancer treatments for non-Hodgkin’s\\n\\nlymphoma,7 contending these medical needs amount to “extraordinary\\n\\ncircumstances” under Rule 35, 8 because his treatment cannot be provided by DOC.9\\n\\nDefendant claims communications problems with DOC “has caused (most rapidly)\\n\\na deadly decline in his health,”10 which if not addressed will “likely have fatal\\n\\n1\\n  D.I. 10.\\n2\\n  See D.I. 11. Defendant was sentenced as follows: (1) for the Assault First Degree charge, ten\\nyears at Level V, suspended after two years, for eight years at Level IV, suspended after six\\nmonths, for eighteen months at Level III; (2) for the Robbery First Degree charge, three years at\\nLevel V; and (3) for the two counts of PFDCF, three years at Level V as to each charge.

The Court asked the State to respond. On April 21, 2023, the State\\n\\nconfirmed it had consulted with Dr. Awele Maduka-Ezeh, Medical Director and\\n\\nHealthcare Epidemiologist with DOC, who acknowledges that Defendant’s\\n\\noncological treatment is not available locally, and that incarceration serves as a\\n\\nhindrance to receiving this therapy. 12 Accordingly, the State accepted and adopted\\n\\nDr. Maduka-Ezeh’s opinion that release from prison may benefit Defendant to allow\\n\\nhim to access medical care.13 The State further submitted a request that should this\\n\\nCourt grant relief, supervision protocols with DOC be established prior to\\n\\nDefendant’s release. 14\\n\\n        5.     The Court is sympathetic to Defendant’s medical condition and his\\n\\nrequest for relief. The Court also appreciates the State’s response to consider release\\n\\nthrough Rule 35. Defendant, however, is still serving the minimum mandatory\\n\\nperiod of his sentence. And although the Court has wide discretion to reduce a\\n\\nsentence upon a timely Rule 35(b) application, which this is not, the Court has no\\n\\nauthority to reduce or suspend the mandatory portion of any substantive minimum\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n   Id. ¶ 16.\\n12\\n   D.I. 37.\\n13\\n   Id.\\n14\\n   Id.\\n                                          3\\n\fsentence.15 Thus, under Rule 35, the relief is not available.\\n\\n       6.      Not only does the Court lack the authority, Defendant remains time\\n\\nbarred under Rule 35(b), where his motion is made more than ninety days after the\\n\\nsentence was imposed. 16 Even if this Court could consider the motion, to overcome\\n\\nthe time bar, Defendant must show that “extraordinary circumstances”17 forgive the\\n\\ntardiness of his Motion. 18 These circumstances do not constitute extraordinary\\n\\ncircumstances under Rule 35.\\n\\n       7.      Lastly, “[t]he court will not consider repetitive requests for reduction of\\n\\nsentence.”19 A motion is considered repetitive when it “is preceded by an earlier\\n\\nRule 35(b) motion, even if the subsequent motion raises new arguments.” 20 The bar\\n\\nis absolute and flatly “prohibits repetitive requests for reduction of sentence.”21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n   State v.

Procedural History and Relevant Facts\\n\\n          {¶ 2} On February 5, 2021, McCurty was indicted on two counts of murder, in\\n\\nviolation of R.C. 2903.02(B), unclassified felonies; one count of felonious assault (serious\\n\\nphysical harm), in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the second degree; two\\n\\ncounts of felonious assault (deadly weapon), in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), felonies\\n\\nof the second degree; and two counts of having weapons while under disability, in\\n\\nviolation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), felonies of the third degree. Except for the offenses of\\n\\nhaving weapons under disability, the charges included three-year firearm specifications.\\n\\n          {¶ 3} On March 29, 2021, McCurty filed a motion to suppress challenging the\\n\\npretrial identification of a witness, but this motion was later withdrawn. A second motion\\n\\nto suppress was filed on May 3, 2021, alleging that evidence should be suppressed as\\n\\nthe result of a warrantless search and that McCurty’s statements were obtained in\\n\\nviolation of Miranda, or in the alternative, were the result of an improper warrantless\\n\\narrest.\\n\\n          {¶ 4} A suppression hearing was held on August 16, 2021. At the hearing, the\\n\\nState offered the testimony of two witnesses.         In his post-hearing brief, McCurty\\n\\nspecifically argued that, at the time he was arrested without a warrant, there had been no\\n\\nprobable cause to arrest him and, further, that the State did not demonstrate that it had\\n\\nbeen impracticable to obtain a warrant or that exigent circumstances had existed. Thus,\\n\\nhe argued that his seizure had been unconstitutional. The trial court overruled McCurty’s\\n\\nmotion in its entirety, finding that there had been probable cause to arrest McCurty and\\n\\nthat it had not been practicable for the police to obtain a warrant prior to doing so. The\\n\f                                                                                               -3-\\n\\n\\ntrial court also found that McCurty’s statements were admissible as they had been\\n\\nknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made after he validly waived his Miranda rights.\\n\\n          {¶ 5} The case proceeded to a jury trial on the murder and felonious assault counts\\n\\nwith firearm specifications, and the two counts of having a weapon while under disability\\n\\nwere tried to the bench. The jury found McCurty guilty of two counts of murder and two\\n\\ncounts of felonious assault (and the firearm specifications) which related to the shooting\\n\\ndeath of J.G.1 McCurty was found not guilty of the third felonious assault count related\\n\\nto W.T., who was standing next to J.G. at the time of the shooting. The trial court found\\n\\nMcCurty guilty on both counts of having a weapon while under disability.\\n\\n          {¶ 6} At sentencing, the trial court merged all the murder and felonious assault\\n\\ncounts and the State elected sentencing on count one, murder, on which the trial court\\n\\nimposed a sentence of 15-years-to-life in prison with an additional mandatory 3-year\\n\\nfirearm specification. McCurty was sentenced to 18 months in prison on each of the\\n\\nhaving a weapon while under disability counts, which were ordered to be served\\n\\nconcurrently to each other and concurrently to the murder count, for a total = prison term\\n\\nof 18-years-to-life.\\n\\n           II.   Motion to Suppress\\n\\n          {¶ 7} McCurty timely appealed and raises the following single assignment of error:\\n\\n          The trial court erred in overruling McCurty’s motion to suppress evidence\\n\\n          because the state failed to show that obtaining an arrest warrant beforehand\\n\\n          was impracticable under the circumstances. Because the police did not\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n    In order to protect the privacy of minors, we will use initials throughout this opinion.\\n\f                                                                                          -4-\\n\\n\\n       validly arrest McCurty, any statements made by McCurty must also be\\n\\n       suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.\\n\\n       {¶ 8} The trial court found that there had been probable cause to arrest McCurty\\n\\nand that it had been impracticable to obtain a warrant prior to his arrest. McCurty does\\n\\nnot challenge the trial court’s finding of probable cause. Rather, McCurty contends the\\n\\ntrial court erred because the State failed to show that obtaining an arrest warrant was\\n\\nimpracticable. McCurty asserts that the failure to demonstrate impracticability\\n\\nnecessitates reversal of his convictions.\\n\\n       {¶ 9} McCurty relies on this Court’s prior decision in State v. VanNoy, 188 Ohio\\n\\nApp.3d 89, 2010-Ohio-2845, 934 N.E.2d 413 (2d Dist.), to support his position.             In\\n\\nVanNoy, the defendant was under investigation by the Springfield Police Department drug\\n\\nunit during the spring of 2008. Id. at ¶ 9. Several months later, a Springfield detective\\n\\nobserved the defendant as a passenger in a vehicle and conducted a traffic stop solely\\n\\nto arrest the defendant for the prior drug offenses. Id. at ¶ 11-12. At the time of the stop,\\n\\nthere had been no arrest warrant issued for VanNoy, no charges had been filed against\\n\\nhim, and no indictment had been obtained. Id. at ¶ 10. Although the trial court overruled\\n\\nVanNoy’s motion to suppress, this Court reversed, holding that “in order for an officer to\\n\\nlawfully perform a warrantless arrest in a public place, the arrest must not only be\\n\\nsupported by probable cause, it must also be shown that obtaining an arrest warrant\\n\\nbeforehand was impracticable under the circumstances, i.e., that exigent circumstances\\n\\nexist.” (Citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 23.\\n\\n       {¶ 10} However, in 2021, the Supreme Court of Ohio explicitly rejected the holding\\n\f                                                                                        -5-\\n\\n\\nin VanNoy that required the State to show that obtaining an arrest warrant before arresting\\n\\na suspect without a warrant was impracticable under the circumstances, in addition to the\\n\\narrest being supported by probable cause. State v. Jordan, 166 Ohio St.3d 339, 2021-\\n\\nOhio-3922, 185 N.E.3d 1051, ¶ 29. The Supreme Court stated that VanNoy was “contrary\\n\\nto precedent from both this court and the United States Supreme Court.” Id. at ¶ 32. The\\n\\nCourt then held “that neither the United States nor the Ohio Constitution requires a\\n\\nshowing of exigent circumstances or of the impracticability of obtaining an arrest warrant\\n\\nto justify a warrantless public arrest supported by probable cause.” Id.\\n\\n       {¶ 11} As the Court in Jordan explained, “[t]he constitutionality of an arrest\\n\\ndepends on whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause\\n\\nto make it.” Id. at ¶ 19, citing Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d\\n\\n142 (1964). “An arrest that is based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under\\n\\nthe Fourth Amendment[.]” Id., citing United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94\\n\\nS.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Thus, so long as a warrantless arrest is based upon\\n\\nprobable cause and occurs in a public place, it does not violate the Fourth Amendment.\\n\\nId. at ¶ 28, citing State v. Brown, 115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, ¶\\n\\n66, citing U.S. v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598.\\n\\n       {¶ 12} McCurty does not contest the trial courts’ determination that the arresting\\n\\nofficers had probable cause to arrest him. Furthermore, based on Jordan, the State was\\n\\nnot required to demonstrate that obtaining a warrant prior to his arrest was impracticable.\\n\\nTherefore, McCurty’s warrantless arrest, conducted in public and with probable cause to\\n\\nbelieve that McCurty had committed a felony, was reasonable and did not violate the\\n\f                                                                                       -6-\\n\\n\\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 14 of the Ohio\\n\\nConstitution. McCurty’s sole assignment of error is overruled.\\n\\n       III.   Conclusion\\n\\n      {¶ 13} Having overruled the assignment of error, the judgment of the trial court is\\n\\naffirmed.\\n\\n                                    .............\\n\\n\\n\\nEPLEY, J. and HUFFMAN, J., concur.\\n\f\n",

R. 1:38-3(d).\\n\fPER CURIAM\\n\\n      Plaintiff M.L.S. appeals from a December 16, 2019 order dismissing a\\n\\ncomplaint she filed against defendant J.S.S. pursuant to the Prevention of\\n\\nDomestic Violence Act (PDVA), N.J.S.A. 2C:25-17 to -35. We affirm.\\n\\n      The domestic violence matter arose in the midst of the parties' long,\\n\\ncontentious divorce. Plaintiff commenced the divorce action in 2015 and the\\n\\nparties have lived separately since then.     In the matrimonial proceeding,\\n\\ndefendant filed several enforcement motions against plaintiff to compel her to\\n\\npay support, which the court granted and enforced via a bench warrant. On\\n\\nOctober 10, 2019, one day prior to the return date of an enforcement motion,\\n\\nplaintiff filed her domestic violence complaint and obtained a temporary\\n\\nrestraining order (TRO).\\n\\n      The complaint alleged defendant stalked plaintiff because she discovered\\n\\nhe \"hired a company named [Spytech] and . . . discovered that def[endant] had\\n\\nbeen tracking [her].\" The complaint asserted plaintiff discovered a tracking\\n\\ndevice on her car in May 2019 and \"learned from a [third] party that def[endant]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                        A-2103-19T1\\n                                       2\\n\fstated he had [plaintiff] followed.\"2 As for the history of domestic violence, the\\n\\ncomplaint alleged \"in 2015, def[endant] told plaintiff to stop her relationship\\n\\nwith one of her friends and if not[,] he would physically hurt her friend.\"3 The\\n\\ncomplaint also alleged \"def[endant] in anger blocked pl[aintiff] from leaving in\\n\\n2015 by parking [in front of] pl[aintiff] for [fifteen] min[ute]s.\" Plaintiff also\\n\\nalleged defendant \"slammed kitchen cups violently in anger.\"\\n\\n      At the ensuing three-day trial, plaintiff testified and presented testimony\\n\\nby S.C., plaintiff's former employee and close friend; and a BMW service\\n\\nadvisor who found the alleged tracking device on plaintiff's vehicle. Plaintiff's\\n\\ncounsel subpoenaed and called defendant to the stand.         However, because\\n\\nplaintiff filed a separate criminal action against defendant, he invoked his Fifth\\n\\nAmendment privilege and declined to testify.\\n\\n      S.C. testified she was in a Starbucks on January 9, 2019, when she saw\\n\\ndefendant enter the store. She observed defendant meeting with an unknown\\n\\nman, telling him \"[s]he drives a late model BMW\" and \"the parking is under the\\n\\nbuilding.\"   S.C. saw the unknown man take notes during the meeting and\\n\\n\\n2\\n   The complaint alleged another predicate incident of domestic violence, but\\nthere was no testimony adduced and it is not part of this appeal.\\n3\\n  The testimony at trial revealed the relationship was not romantic, but rather a\\nspiritual one with a cleric.\\n                                                                          A-2103-19T1\\n                                        3\\n\fbelieved the conversation was about plaintiff. S.C. testified the conversation\\n\\nmade her believe plaintiff was in \"immediate danger,\" and she contacted\\n\\nplaintiff the following day.\\n\\n      The service advisor testified plaintiff brought her BMW to his shop on\\n\\nMay 30, 2019, claiming she had a damaged tire and that something was hanging\\n\\ndown off the bumper. The shop replaced plaintiff's tire and removed a black\\n\\nbox that was duct taped to the car. The service advisor testified that when he\\n\\nopened the box, he found a USB cable connected to a light switch, and it looked\\n\\nlike \"some kind of tracking device.\" He informed plaintiff about the box, and\\n\\nshe called the police. When police arrived, they questioned the service advisor\\n\\nabout the box and took the item as evidence.\\n\\n      Plaintiff testified she learned about Spytech because she saw three entries\\n\\non defendant's February and March 2019 credit card statements, in the amount\\n\\nof $24.95 payable to STI. She claimed she performed a reverse telephone look\\n\\nup and determined the number on the credit card statements belonged to\\n\\nSpytech. Plaintiff learned the company offered monitoring and tracking services\\n\\nby visiting its website. She called the company and learned the only product\\n\\noffered for $24.95 was a tracking service.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                         A-2103-19T1\\n                                       4\\n\f      Plaintiff testified to the history of domestic violence and claimed she was\\n\\nfearful of defendant. She explained since the day the device was found on her\\n\\ncar, she spoke with police weekly and one such conversation, in October 2019,\\n\\nled her to believe she \"was unsafe continuing the way it was going.\" Further,\\n\\nshe \"wanted to file a restraining order at that point, based on [the] information\\n\\nfrom the police.\" Plaintiff never elaborated on the conversation's substance.\\n\\n      The trial judge rendered a comprehensive oral decision. She found S.C.'s\\n\\ntestimony was not credible because it \"appeared somewhat contrived . . . [and]\\n\\nmotivated by the fact that [plaintiff] has evidently been good to her and has an\\n\\nemployment relationship with her, which she underplayed.\" She noted a photo\\n\\nS.C. took, which purported to be of defendant's meeting with the unknown man,\\n\\nwas not persuasive because \"one does not see . . . defendant's face.\" The judge\\n\\nfurther stated:\\n\\n                    I have great difficulty believing that in the middle\\n             of a busy Starbucks at 9:00 a.m. [S.C.] would have been\\n             able to hear such a conversation from some [fifteen]\\n             feet away, particularly when . . . defendant had his back\\n             to her. . . .\\n\\n                  Most importantly, if, in fact, [S.C.] heard this\\n             conversation, and told . . . plaintiff the very next day,\\n             why didn't . . . plaintiff do anything about it?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                           A-2103-19T1\\n                                         5\\n\f      The judge accepted the service advisor's testimony \"that a box was found\\n\\ntaped to the plaintiff's car,\" but it did not persuade her it \"was a tracking device.\\n\\nNor did it establish who taped this device to the car.\" The judge further noted\\n\\nneither the device nor a picture of it was offered in evidence.\\n\\n      The judge found plaintiff's testimony neither \"credible [n]or convincing.\"\\n\\nShe noted plaintiff did not seek a TRO until five months after finding the alleged\\n\\ntracking device. The judge stated: \"[Plaintiff] claims [the delay] was because\\n\\nof what the police told her in late September early October, [however] . . . [s]he\\n\\ndid not testify as to what she learned in that conversation that would ha[ve]\\n\\nprompted her to seek a [TRO] at that point.\"\\n\\n      The judge also found plaintiff did not link the charges discovered on\\n\\ndefendant's credit card to the device on the vehicle. The judge found plaintiff's\\n\\nexplanation regarding her investigation of the charges leading to her discovery\\n\\nof the payments to Spytech not credible because defendant received the\\n\\nstatements in response to a subpoena, after plaintiff filed the domestic violence\\n\\ncomplaint.\\n\\n      The trial judge concluded the evidence did not support plaintiff's\\n\\ntestimony that she feared defendant. The judge noted plaintiff never explained\\n\\nwhy she waited until October to file her complaint, despite learning about the\\n\\n\\n                                                                             A-2103-19T1\\n                                         6\\n\fStarbucks meeting from S.C. in January and learning about the device affixed to\\n\\nher car in May. The judge stated:\\n\\n            This is not a case in which . . . plaintiff is a dependent\\n            spouse living with . . . defendant and small children,\\n            feeling like she has no alternative. This is a case in\\n            which the parties separated almost four years ago.\\n            Plaintiff runs a substantial real estate business,\\n            investment business, is financially independent[,] and\\n            has grown[,] emancipated children. The parties have\\n            been in court on their divorce case on numerous\\n            occasions since plaintiff first learned of defendant's\\n            alleged stalking.\\n\\n                  ....\\n\\n                   Moreover, I found plaintiff's demeanor during the\\n            final hearing and throughout the divorce proceedings to\\n            be very revealing. At no time was her fear of . . .\\n            defendant evident.\\n\\nThe judge noted plaintiff never referenced the alleged domestic violence in the\\n\\nmatrimonial \"certifications she signed and filed with the [c]ourt between\\n\\nFebruary and October[, . . . and] participated in an intensive all-day settlement\\n\\nconference in court on June 19th of this year and never expressed any discomfort\\n\\nor fear of . . . defendant when in the same room[.]\"\\n\\n      The judge concluded the allegations of domestic violence were motivated\\n\\nby the adverse rulings in the matrimonial matter. The judge noted plaintiff was\\n\\nplaced on a bench warrant status \"just six days before . . . plaintiff took her\\n\\n\\n                                                                         A-2103-19T1\\n                                        7\\n\fBMW to the shop, only to have the shop find the device on the car.\" The judge\\n\\nalso noted defendant sought enforcement of litigant's rights throughout the\\n\\nsummer. Plaintiff denied that her anger about defendant's enforcement efforts\\n\\nmotivated her to file the domestic violence complaint. However, the judge\\n\\nrejected her testimony, finding \"her testimony about not being sure what the\\n\\nconsequence would be[] if she failed to comply with the [c]ourt's May . . . order\\n\\nto be disingenuous. In fact, at times it appeared to me that her confusion or lack\\n\\nof clarity was purposeful.\"\\n\\n      The judge concluded plaintiff's motive to file the domestic violence\\n\\ncomplaint, one day before the return date of defendant's enforcement motion\\n\\nseeking plaintiff's arrest for failing to comply with the May order, was to avoid\\n\\npaying the support or incarceration.         The judge dismissed the complaint\\n\\nconcluding plaintiff failed to \"sustain her burden of establishing by a\\n\\npreponderance of the credible evidence that . . . defendant engaged in a predicate\\n\\nact of domestic violence, or that a [f]inal [r]estraining [o]rder [FRO] is necessary\\n\\nto protect her from immediate danger or further abuse.\"\\n\\n      Plaintiff raises the following points on appeal:\\n\\n            I.

Cesare, 154 N.J. 394, 412\\n\\n(1998) (citing Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Invs. Ins. Co., 65 N.J. 474, 484\\n\\n(1974)). An appellate court may not set aside a trial court's factual findings\\n\\nunless convinced they \"are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with\\n\\nthe competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the\\n\\ninterests of justice.\" Ibid. (quoting Rova Farms, 65 N.J. at 484).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                       A-2103-19T1\\n                                        9\\n\f      We defer to fact-finding by the Family Part because of its \"special\\n\\nexpertise in the field of domestic relations.\" Ibid. (citing Brennan v.

Manalapan Realty, LP v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan,\\n\\n140 N.J. 366, 378 (1995).\\n\\n      We address Points I and II together, which concern defendant's invocation\\n\\nof his Fifth Amendment privilege against incrimination. Plaintiff argues the\\n\\ntrial judge erred because defendant waived his Fifth Amendment privilege by\\n\\nadducing in evidence a certification from the matrimonial matter in which he\\n\\n\"made numerous allegations . . . that [p]laintiff exhibited a pattern of behavior\\n\\ndesign[ed] to impose improper leverage on him . . . [including] the religious\\n\\ncourt, the parties' children, and the parties' religious and social community to\\n\\ninfluence [d]efendant to withdraw his contempt application against her.\"\\n\\nPlaintiff argues defendant used this certification to support his defense theory\\n\\nthat she should be denied an FRO because she did not fear him. She argues\\n\\ndefendant's actions not only show he waived his privilege against self-\\n\\n\\n                                                                          A-2103-19T1\\n                                       10\\n\fincrimination, but required the judge draw an adverse inference against him for\\n\\nnot testifying.\\n\\n        Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:84A-19 and N.J.R.E. 503, a person has \"a right\\n\\nto refuse to disclose in an action . . . any matter that will incriminate him or\\n\\nexpose him to a penalty[.]\" However, an individual's privilege against self-\\n\\nincrimination may be waived where the individual voluntarily testifies regarding\\n\\na matter falling under the privilege. Attor v. Attor, 384 N.J. Super. 154, 166\\n\\n(App. Div. 2006).\\n\\n        In a civil action, a judge may draw an adverse inference when a party\\n\\ninvokes his or her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. State,\\n\\nDep't of Law & Pub. Safety, Div. of Gaming Enf't v. Merlino, 216 N.J. Super.\\n\\n579, 587 (App. Div. 1987). But an adverse inference is only permitted where\\n\\nthere is additional evidence to support an adverse finding. Ibid. The decision\\n\\nwhether to draw an adverse inference is left to the discretion of the trial judge.\\n\\nIbid.\\n\\n        We reject plaintiff's arguments. The certification defendant proffered in\\n\\nevidence contained no admissions of domestic violence and instead contained\\n\\nhis assertions that plaintiff was attempting an \"end run\" around the matrimonial\\n\\ncourt's enforcement of its pendente lite support order to pressure him to\\n\\n\\n                                                                          A-2103-19T1\\n                                       11\\n\fcapitulate in the divorce proceeding. The trial judge did not abuse her discretion\\n\\nby declining to draw an adverse inference for defendant's failure to testify in the\\n\\ndomestic violence proceeding.\\n\\n      In Point III of her brief, plaintiff asserts the trial judge adjudicated the\\n\\ncase using a clear and convincing standard rather than under a preponderance of\\n\\nthe evidence. As we noted, the trial judge stated she \"did not find [plaintiff's]\\n\\ntestimony to be credible or convincing.\" This fleeting reference did not signal\\n\\nthe judge had elevated plaintiff's burden of proof because in the following\\n\\nparagraph of the trial judge's decision she concluded plaintiff had not met the\\n\\nburden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. This argument lacks\\n\\nsufficient merit to warrant further discussion in a written opinion. R. 2:11-\\n\\n3(e)(1)(E).\\n\\n      In Points IV and V, plaintiff challenges the trial judge's findings of fact\\n\\nand conclusion plaintiff did not require the protection of an FRO. Plaintiff\\n\\nargues the decision is inconsistent with the facts because: the judge said S.C.\\n\\nwas fifteen feet away when she overheard the conversation in Starbucks,\\n\\nwhereas S.C. testified she sat just three feet away; defendant did not testify, yet\\n\\nthe judge credited argument by his counsel that he was disputing the credit card\\n\\ncharges to STI; the finding that plaintiff could not have known about STI until\\n\\n\\n                                                                           A-2103-19T1\\n                                       12\\n\fafter she obtained the TRO was wrong because plaintiff made the allegation in\\n\\nher domestic violence complaint; there was no testimony to support the judge's\\n\\nfinding plaintiff was motivated to bring defendant before a rabbinical court as\\n\\nleverage in the divorce proceeding; the judge faulted plaintiff for delaying\\n\\nobtaining a TRO, yet plaintiff did so only after police confirmed the device taken\\n\\nfrom her car was a GPS tracker; and the judge erred in finding plaintiff did not\\n\\nfear defendant based upon plaintiff's courtroom demeanor in both the domestic\\n\\nviolence and matrimonial matters.\\n\\n      In Silver v. Silver, 387 N.J. Super. 112 (App. Div. 2006) we outlined the\\n\\nanalysis a trial judge must undertake when adjudicating a request for an FRO.\\n\\nWe held:\\n\\n                   First, the judge must determine whether the\\n            plaintiff has proven, by a preponderance of the credible\\n            evidence, that one or more of the predicate acts set forth\\n            in N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19[(a)] has occurred. . . . In\\n            performing that function, \"the [PDVA] does require\\n            that 'acts claimed by a plaintiff to be domestic violence\\n            . . . be evaluated in light of the previous history of\\n            violence between the parties.'\" Cesare, []154 N.J. at\\n            402 . . .

N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(a) defines stalking as follows:\\n\\n           (1) \"Course of conduct\" means repeatedly maintaining\\n           a visual or physical proximity to a person; directly,\\n           indirectly, or through third parties, by any action,\\n           method, device, or means, following, monitoring,\\n           observing, surveilling, threatening, or communicating\\n           to or about, a person, or interfering with a person's\\n           property; repeatedly committing harassment against a\\n           person; or repeatedly conveying, or causing to be\\n           conveyed, verbal or written threats or threats conveyed\\n           by any other means of communication or threats\\n           implied by conduct or a combination thereof directed at\\n           or toward a person.\\n\\n           (2) \"Repeatedly\" means on two or more occasions.\\n\\n\\n                                                                      A-2103-19T1\\n                                     14\\n\f            (3) \"Emotional distress\" means significant mental\\n            suffering or distress.\\n\\n            (4) \"Cause a reasonable person to fear\" means to cause\\n            fear which a reasonable victim, similarly situated,\\n            would have under the circumstances.\\n\\nN.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(b) states:\\n\\n            A person is guilty of stalking, a crime of the fourth\\n            degree, if he purposefully or knowingly engages in a\\n            course of conduct directed at a specific person that\\n            would cause a reasonable person to fear for his safety\\n            or the safety of a third person or suffer other emotional\\n            distress.\\n\\n      The record supports the trial judge's findings that plaintiff failed to prove\\n\\neither the predicate act of stalking or the need for the protection of an FRO. It\\n\\nis true S.C. testified she sat three feet away when she heard the conversation in\\n\\nStarbucks. However, the trial judge's misstatement of the distance does not\\n\\nconvince us there was reversible error.       Indeed, the judge rejected S.C.'s\\n\\ntestimony for several other reasons, including that: S.C. waited a day to tell\\n\\nplaintiff about the conversation, despite S.C.'s professed alarm about what she\\n\\noverheard; neither plaintiff nor S.C. immediately contacted the police; and\\n\\nplaintiff and S.C. were good friends and also had an employer-employee\\n\\nrelationship, yet they never discussed the outcome of the incident after S.C.\\n\\nrelayed the information to plaintiff.       The judge concluded these factors\\n\\n\\n                                                                           A-2103-19T1\\n                                       15\\n\fundermined S.C.'s credibility and the judge's mistaken recitation of one facet of\\n\\nS.C.'s testimony is not cause for us to disturb her credibility findings to which\\n\\nwe owe deference. The error cited by plaintiff was harmless. R. 2:10-2.\\n\\n      We also reject the argument defendant was required to testify about his\\n\\ncredit card bills in order to have them admitted into evidence because plaintiff\\n\\nadmitted the documents in her case in chief. Those statements reflected the STI\\n\\ncharges for $24.95 bearing an asterisk as well as credits in the same amount.\\n\\nThe statements explained the asterisks as follows: \"*This statement contains a\\n\\nsecurity credit adjustment for a charge disputed as unauthorized.\" Therefore,\\n\\ndefendant's testimony was unnecessary to prove these facts, especially\\n\\nconsidering plaintiff testified to the charges credited back to defendant's card on\\n\\ncross-examination.\\n\\n      Similarly, the objective evidence in the record proved plaintiff received\\n\\nthe credit card statements showing the charges to STI seven days after she filed\\n\\nthe domestic violence complaint. Even though the complaint alleged plaintiff\\n\\n\"discovered that def[endant] hired a company named [Spytech],\" her testimony\\n\\ndid not overcome the objective evidence defendant produced undermining her\\n\\nclaim. Our review of the record does not convince us to reach a different\\n\\nconclusion.\\n\\n\\n                                                                           A-2103-19T1\\n                                       16\\n\f      Finally, we have no cause to disturb the trial judge's findings that plaintiff\\n\\ndid not require an FRO because she did not fear defendant and delayed filing a\\n\\ndomestic violence complaint for strategic reasons.          We have previously\\n\\ncautioned against using a domestic violence action to gain the upper hand in a\\n\\npending divorce litigation. Murray v. Murray, 267 N.J. Super. 406, 410 (App.\\n\\nDiv. 1993).\\n\\n      Here, the record amply supports the trial judge's findings that plaintiff\\n\\nfiled the domestic violence complaint in order to avoid an impending adverse\\n\\noutcome in the divorce litigation. The judge relied on more than plaintiff's delay\\n\\nto conclude the filing was motivated by considerations other than domestic\\n\\nviolence. Likewise, we have no basis to second guess the judge's observations\\n\\nthat plaintiff did not fear defendant.      This, coupled with lack of credible\\n\\nevidence of a repeated course of conduct orchestrated by defendant to follow,\\n\\nmonitor, observe, surveil, threaten, or communicate with plaintiff to cause her\\n\\nsignificant mental suffering, distress, or fear required to prove stalking,\\n\\nconvinces us there was no reversible error.\\n\\n      Affirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                            A-2103-19T1\\n                                       17\\n\f\n",

                                             v.\\n\\n                                  The State of Texas, Appellee\\n\\n\\n                FROM THE 207TH DISTRICT COURT OF HAYS COUNTY\\n       NO. CR-19-0800-B, THE HONORABLE JACK H. ROBISON, JUDGE PRESIDING\\n\\n\\n\\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\\n\\n\\n               Appellant Bo Michael Dresner stands charged by indictment with multiple child\\n\\nsexual abuse offenses and numerous counts of possession with intent to promote child\\n\\npornography. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 21.02(a) (continuous sexual abuse of young child or\\n\\nchildren), 21.11(a)(1) (indecency with child by sexual contact), 22.021(a)(1)(B) (aggravated\\n\\nsexual assault of child), 43.26(a), (f) (possession with intent to promote child pornography). He\\n\\nseeks to appeal the trial court’s order denying his pretrial request for bond reduction.\\n\\n               In criminal cases, the standard for determining jurisdiction of an appellate court\\n\\n“is not whether the appeal is precluded by law, but whether the appeal is authorized by law.\\n\\nRagston v. State, 424 S.W.3d 49, 52 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (quoting Abbott v. State,\\n\\n271 S.W.3d 694, 696–97 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)); Blanton v. State, 369 S.W.3d 894, 902 (Tex.\\n\\nCrim. App. 2012); State ex rel. Lykos v. Fine, 330 S.W.3d 904, 915 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\\n\fThis standard extends to interlocutory appeals as well: “‘The courts of appeals do not have\\n\\njurisdiction to review interlocutory orders unless that jurisdiction has been expressly granted by\\n\\nlaw.’” Ragston, 424 S.W.3d at 52 (quoting Apolinar v. State, 820 S.W.2d 792, 794 (Tex. Crim.\\n\\nApp. 1991)); see Tex. Const. art. V, § 6(a) (providing that courts of appeals have appellate\\n\\njurisdiction “under such restrictions and regulations as may be prescribed by law”). “There is no\\n\\nconstitutional or statutory authority granting the courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear\\n\\ninterlocutory appeals regarding excessive bail or the denial of bail.” Ragston, 424 S.W.3d at 52.\\n\\n               Here, although the order that appellant seeks to appeal is, somewhat confusingly,\\n\\nentitled Final Order on Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus or Order on Motion to Reduce\\n\\nBond and Order on Conditions of Bond, the record demonstrates that the trial court’s order\\n\\ndenied appellant’s motion to reduce bond not an application for writ of habeas corpus.1\\n\\nCompare id. at 52 (holding courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to consider interlocutory\\n\\nappeals of denial of pretrial motion for bond reduction) with e.g., Ex parte Gill, 413 S.W.3d 425,\\n\\n426 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (considering appeal from denial of application for writ of habeas\\n\\ncorpus under Article 17.151).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       1   The record reflects that eight months before appellant filed his motion to reduce bond,\\nthe trial court denied a pretrial application for writ of habeas corpus in which appellant sought\\nrelease pursuant to article 17.151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\\nart. 17.151 (requiring release of defendant detained in jail pending trial on personal bond or by\\nbail reduction if State is not ready for trial within specified time period). The appeal of the\\ntrial court’s order denying habeas relief, which was before this Court in cause number\\n03-19-00835-CR, was abated for a hearing pursuant to Rule 38.8 of the Texas Rules of Appellate\\nProcedure. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.8(b)(3). After the hearing, the trial court made fact findings\\nthat reflected that the trial court’s June 15, 2020 ruling denying appellant’s request for a bond\\nreduction—the ruling that the order at issue here memorializes—was a ruling on appellant’s\\nsubsequently filed motion to reduce bond. In addition, citing Ragston v. State, 424 S.W.3d 49,\\n52 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014), the trial court concluded that any appeal of such ruling should be\\ndismissed because appellant had no right to an interlocutory appeal of that decision.\\n                                                2\\n\f               Therefore, because the order that is the subject of this appeal is an interlocutory\\n\\norder denying appellant’s pretrial motion for a bond reduction, it is not an appealable order, and\\n\\nwe lack jurisdiction over this appeal.

J.:                          FILED JANUARY 12, 2021\\n\\n        This is an interlocutory appeal1 by the Commonwealth from an order\\n\\nsuppressing the blood-alcohol-content (“BAC”) report of Defendant, Tina Sue\\n\\nMcKahan, in a driving-under-the-influence case. Ms. McKahan allegedly drove\\n\\ndrunk and crashed her jeep in Greene County, Pennsylvania. 2         Authorities\\n\\ntransported the unresponsive Ms. McKahan across state lines for medical care.\\n\\nAt the request of a police officer from Pennsylvania, the West Virginia State\\n\\nPolice obtained and executed a search warrant for all of Ms. McKahan’s medical\\n\\nrecords, instead of only the BAC report.\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n1   The interlocutory appeal is properly before us. See Pa.R.A.P. 311(d).\\n\\n2The Commonwealth charged Ms. McKahan with having violated 75 Pa.C.S.A.\\n§ 3802(c) (driving under the influence, high rate of alcohol), 75 Pa.C.S.A. §\\n3802(a)(1) (general impairment), and three summary offenses.\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\n       The Pennsylvania trial court deemed West Virginia’s search warrant to\\n\\nbe overly broad in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The court\\n\\ntherefore suppressed the evidence it produced. A divided panel of this Court\\n\\nreversed, and we granted Ms. McKahan’s application for en banc review to\\n\\nresolve the constitutional issues. However, the Commonwealth’s failure to\\n\\npreserve those issues prevents us from doing so.\\n\\n       According to the Commonwealth, around midnight on January 30, 2018,\\n\\nMs. McKahan drove her vehicle in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania while under the\\n\\ninfluence of alcohol.3 The vehicle left the roadway, flipped over, and seriously\\n\\ninjured her. Paramedics took Ms. McKahan to the West Virginia University’s\\n\\nRuby Memorial Hospital, located in nearby Morgantown. During treatment,\\n\\nthe hospital staff drew and analyzed Ms. McKahan’s blood.\\n\\n       Meanwhile, Waynesburg police contacted West Virginia law enforcement\\n\\nfor assistance with investigating Ms. McKahan.      West Virginia State Police\\n\\nprovided a West Virginia magistrate with an affidavit and Waynesburg Officer\\n\\nMargaret Vorum’s written narrative of the incident. The magistrate issued a\\n\\nwarrant authorizing police to search the hospital for, “All the medical records\\n\\nof every nature in any way to any medical treatment rendered on behalf of\\n\\nTina Sue McKahan (1/4/81) since 01/29/2018 . . . .” Id. at 4. The search\\n\\nwarrant then provided an exemplary list “including, but not limited to, copies\\n\\nof the following: (1) All clinical reports; (2) Results of all laboratory tests;\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n3 Ms. McKahan has little to no recollection of the event aside from waking up\\nin the hospital and not signing consent forms. See N.T., 8/30/18, at 37-39.\\n\\n                                           -2-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) All notes, correspondences, or records of any nature made by any\\n\\nphysicians, nurses, or any other persons concerning Tina Sue McKahan’s\\n\\ncondition or [her] treatment.” Id.\\n\\n       The hospital gave 158 pages of Ms. McKahan’s medical records,\\n\\nincluding the BAC report, to the West Virginia state trooper.     The trooper\\n\\nforwarded all of the records to Officer Vorum. She leafed through them, found\\n\\nthe BAC report, and charged Ms. McKahan with various offenses, including\\n\\nDUI.\\n\\n       Ms. McKahan moved to suppress her medical records under the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment and Article I, § 8 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of\\n\\nPennsylvania. She argued, among other things, that the search warrant was\\n\\nunconstitutionally broad, because it authorized police to search the hospital\\n\\nfor and to seize all her medical records, rather than just the BAC report.\\n\\n       In response, the Commonwealth argued the warrant was not overly\\n\\nbroad but, if so, suppressing the BAC report was inappropriate. To support\\n\\nits argument, the Commonwealth offered a theory rooted in the federal good-\\n\\nfaith exception to the warrant requirement. The District Attorney of Greene\\n\\nCounty argued before the suppression court that, “the exclusionary rule is\\n\\n[n]ever meant to be a punishment; it’s meant to keep out irrelevant\\n\\nevidence.”   N.T., 8/30/18, at 43. The Commonwealth did not raise the issue\\n\\nof inevitable discovery at the suppression hearing or in its memorandum of\\n\\nlaw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     -3-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\n      After reviewing the search warrant, its accompanying documents, and\\n\\nthe parties’ post-hearing memoranda of law, the suppression court ruled that\\n\\nthe search warrant was overly broad and unparticularized in its list of items\\n\\nto be seized. Thus, it granted Ms. McKahan’s motion to suppress. Because\\n\\nthe Commonwealth did not assert that the inevitable-discovery exception\\n\\napplied, the suppression did not address that issue in its orders or opinions.\\n\\nThis timely appeal followed.\\n\\n      The Commonwealth raises one issue: “Did the [suppression] court err\\n\\nin determining the [BAC] results should be included in its suppression order\\n\\n. . . ?” Commonwealth’s Brief at 4.\\n\\n      On appeal, the Commonwealth makes no challenge to the suppression\\n\\ncourt’s determination that the search warrant was unconstitutionally broad.\\n\\nMoreover, in the argument potion of its brief, the Commonwealth relies solely\\n\\nupon the doctrine     of inevitable discovery to      redeem the otherwise\\n\\nunconstitutional search and seizure.        See id. at 16-17.        Thus, the\\n\\nCommonwealth abandons its suppression-hearing theory that the purpose of\\n\\nthe exclusionary rule is not to punish police misconduct. See N.T., 8/30/18\\n\\nat 43. Instead, it shifts its rationale for excusing the unconstitutional search\\n\\nwarrant from the good-faith exception to a claim of inevitable discovery.\\n\\n      Before reaching the merits of the Commonwealth’s argument, we must\\n\\ndecide whether it properly preserved that issue for our appellate review. “The\\n\\napplicability of waiver principles presents a question of law, over which our\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                      -4-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.” Stapas v.\\n\\nGiant Eagle, Inc., 198 A.3d 1033, 1037 (Pa. 2018).\\n\\n      Preserving an issue “is foundational to proper appellate review.” Trigg\\n\\nv. Children’s Hosp. of Pittsburgh of UPMC, 229 A.3d 260, 269 (Pa. 2020).\\n\\n“Requiring issues to be properly raised first in the trial court ensures that trial\\n\\njudges have the opportunity to consider a potential appellate issue and correct\\n\\nany error at the first available opportunity.” Id. This Court “exceed[s its]\\n\\nscope of appellate review by considering an issue that was not preserved”\\n\\nbelow. Id. at 275 (Wecht, J. concurring).\\n\\n      We first observe how the federal good-faith exception to the suppression\\n\\nremedy differs from the admissibility of evidence under doctrine of inevitable\\n\\ndiscovery.\\n\\n      A classic example of the good-faith exception is found in United States\\n\\nv. Franz, 772 F.3d 134 (3d Cir. 2014). There, the United States Court of\\n\\nAppeals for the Third Circuit considered a search warrant with the same\\n\\nconstitutional defect as the one at bar. As in the instant case, investigators\\n\\nin Franz secured a search warrant based on probable cause to believe that\\n\\ninculpating evidence was inside the building to be search. Also like this case,\\n\\nthe warrant did not comply with the constitution’s demand that search warrant\\n\\n“particularly describ[e] the . . . things to be seized.” U.S. Const. amnd. IV.\\n\\nHence, investigators “violated Franz’s Fourth Amendment rights, because,\\n\\n[the warrant] did not contain a particularized list of items to be seized.” Franz\\n\\nat 144. The court said the question before it was “not whether there was a\\n\\n                                       -5-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\nconstitutional violation; there was. The question [was] whether that violation\\n\\nnecessitates the suppression of the evidence obtained pursuant to the” invalid\\n\\nsearch warrant.4 Id.\\n\\n       Franz argued the Fourth Amendment analysis should cease once the\\n\\ncourt determined the search warrant failed to list the items to be seized. In\\n\\nhis view, the technical violation required suppression. The court disagreed.\\n\\nInstead, it performed the good-faith-exception analysis of United States v.\\n\\nLeon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).\\n\\n       Under Leon, “we consider not only any defects in the warrant but also\\n\\nthe officer’s conduct in obtaining and executing the warrant and what the\\n\\nofficer knew or should have known.” Franz at 147. Because the investigating\\n\\nofficer made an honest mistake by not particularly listing the items to be\\n\\nseized on the search warrant and did not intend to violate the defendant’s\\n\\nrights, the corrective purpose of suppression would not be served by invoking\\n\\nthat remedy. There was no point in punishing the investigators for negligently\\n\\ndrafting the warrant. Affirming the denial of suppression, the court explained\\n\\nthat “application of the exclusionary rule would provide little deterrent effect\\n\\nand would not justify the costs of suppression” in light the investigator’s\\n\\nhonest drafting error. Id. at 149.\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n\\n4 See also Bartholomew v. Pennsylvania, 221 F.3d 425, 429 (3d Cir. 2000)\\n(making clear, in a civil-rights suit, to police officers that not listing particular\\nitems to be seized on a search warrant violates the Fourth Amendment and,\\nhenceforth, such a constitutional violation is actionable for damages).\\n\\n                                           -6-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\n      In the instant case, by arguing to the suppression court that suppression\\n\\nwould unfairly punish the Pennsylvania police for a minor, clerical error by the\\n\\nWest Virginia State Police, the Commonwealth essentially contended that the\\n\\npurpose for the federal exclusionary rule would not be well served by enforcing\\n\\nit here. In other words, the Commonwealth claimed that the police acted in\\n\\ngood faith and did not deserve to be punished for an unintentional violation of\\n\\nMs. McKahan’s Fourth Amendment rights.\\n\\n      On appeal, by contrast, the Commonwealth does not argue either the\\n\\ngood-faith exception to the Fourth Amendment, or that we should refrain from\\n\\npunishing the Waynesburg police for the West Virginia state trooper’s poorly\\n\\ndrafted search warrant.    Thus, the Commonwealth has waived any federal\\n\\nargument that the Waynesburg police acted in good faith. See Pa.R.A.P. 2116\\n\\n(“No question will be considered unless it is stated in the statement of\\n\\nquestions involved or is fairly suggested thereby.”)\\n\\n      Instead, the Commonwealth contends we should apply the doctrine of\\n\\ninevitable discovery to reverse the trial court and allow the BAC report to be\\n\\nadmitted into evidence. To prove inevitable discovery, the Commonwealth\\n\\nmust show that “the evidence in question would inevitably have been\\n\\ndiscovered    without   reference   to   the   police   error   or   misconduct.”\\n\\nCommonwealth v. Fulton, 179 A.3d 475, 489–90 (2018).                 In short, the\\n\\npolice would have eventually uncovered the evidence from a constitutional\\n\\nsource. The Commonwealth has the burdens of production and persuasion in\\n\\nthis regard. See id.\\n\\n                                     -7-\\n\fJ-E02002-20\\n\\n\\n\\n      As we explained however, at the suppression court, the Commonwealth\\n\\ndid not raise or argue how it would have inevitably discovered Ms. McKahan’s\\n\\nBAC report.    See N.T., 8/30/18; see Commonwealth’s Memorandum to\\n\\nSuppression Court. It afforded the suppression court no opportunity to rule\\n\\non whether police would have inevitably discovered this evidence if they had\\n\\nnot first obtained it under the overly broad warrant.    The Commonwealth\\n\\ntherefore failed to apprise the suppression court of this alternative,\\n\\nconstitutional claim.\\n\\n      The Commonwealth may not raise the claim that the officer’s discovery\\n\\nof the BAC report was inevitable for the first time on appeal. We have long\\n\\nheld that “issues, even those of constitutional dimension, are waived if not\\n\\nraised in the trial court.   A new and different theory of relief may not be\\n\\nsuccessfully advanced for the first time on appeal.” Commonwealth v. Pi\\n\\nDelta Psi, Inc., 211 A.3d 875, 884 (Pa. Super. 2019), appeal denied, 221\\n\\nA.3d 644 (Pa. 2019). We are compelled to dismiss the Commonwealth’s sole\\n\\nappellate issue as waived.\\n\\n      Order of suppression affirmed.

      "0     [MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN 3 interest. The Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (“O&C Act”) addresses the use of timberlands in the southwest corner of Oregon., 6 MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN OPINION McKEOWN, Circuit Judge: This case calls on us to consider the intersection of the Antiquities Act, adopted in 1906, and the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (“O&C Act”), adopted in 1937., Because we conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear Murphy’s challenge, we next evaluate whether the Proclamation’s restriction on logging is consistent with the O&C Act., We affirm the district 8 MURPHY CO. V. BIDEN court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States and Soda Mountain., In 1866, the United States made a grant of purportedly “public lands” to private railroad companies to facilitate the construction of a rail line between Oregon and California., 10, 1869, ch. 27, 16 Stat. 47. But the railroads violated the terms of the grant and, by 1893, had failed to dispose of the vast majority of the parcels., L. No. 86, ch. 137, 39 Stat. 218, 220. But the 1916 Act was “more a triumph of expediency than a statesmanlike solution,” and its convoluted timber-for-taxes funding scheme left many Oregon counties in “dire financial straits.” David Maldwyn Ellis, The Oregon and California Railroad Land Grant, 1866-1945, 39 Pac., at 487. The statute reads, in part: [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, which have heretofore or may hereafter be classified as timberlands, and power-site lands valuable for timber, shall be managed ., After reviewing the O&C Act’s plain text and legislative history, we hold that the Proclamation is a valid exercise of the President’s Antiquities Act authority., The opening paragraph of the O&C Act reveals the breadth of congressional purpose: [S]uch portions of the revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands as are or may hereafter come under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, which have heretofore or may hereafter be classified as MURPHY CO., We affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States and Soda Mountain., However, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusion that Proclamation 9564 does not conflict with the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (O&C Act)., We should hold that “[t]he President cannot authorize a secretary ., Although the Antiquities Act does grant the President broad authority to establish national monuments, nowhere does it remotely purport to grant him authority to suspend the operation of another act of Congress., An executive proclamation issued pursuant to a general grant of authority cannot supersede a specific act of Congress., . . . To deny this, would be to affirm . . . that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves ., “Congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act.” Dames & Moore v., v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 600 (1983). And “[u]nder the Youngstown tripartite framework, congressional acquiescence is pertinent when the President’s action falls within the second category—that is, when he ‘acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority.’” Medellin v., Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991). Moreover, even an affirmative act of Congress cannot grant the President the power to indefinitely modify or nullify duly enacted law., I can find no limiting principle within the majority opinion that counsels otherwise., I think it manifestly more sensible to apply a different presumption: I would not construe a statute to grant the President unfettered authority to indefinitely suspend or cancel the operation of federal law, see id., IV Notwithstanding the undeniable conflict between Proclamation 9564 and the O&C Act, the majority concludes they can be reconciled because the O&C Act “delegated ample discretion to the Department of the Interior to manage the lands in a flexible manner.” But it is unclear how the mere grant of discretion as to how a sustained yield analysis should be conducted can justify the President’s total prohibition on even engaging in a sustained yield analysis in MURPHY CO., United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019). Given the O&C Act incorporated O&C lands “heretofore” and “hereafter” classified as timberlands, rather than grant the Secretary unbounded discretion, it seems more likely that Congress intended for the Secretary to classify O&C land consistent with past practice, meaning “lands bearing a growth of timber not less than three hundred thousand” board feet per 40 acres.]\n",

Factual For the purposes of resolving CNA’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court assumes the facts alleged in the Fourth Amended Complaint to be true and construes them in Ms., See FAC, ECF No. 214 ¶¶ 1, 153-68. B. Procedural On March 5, 2018, CNA filed this Motion to Dismiss Ms., &amp; Opp’n Def. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Counts V &amp; VI Fourth Am., in Further Supp. Mot.

(“Def.’s Opp’n”), ECF No., Objs. R. &amp; R. CNA’s Mot. Dismiss Counts (“Pl.’s Reply”), ECF No., Oct. 30, 2009)). B. Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) provides for dismissal of an action for “lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” Fed., R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, the party asserting jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that the Court has subject matter 6 jurisdiction over the case., of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182–83, (1936)). “Because Rule 12(b)(1) concerns a court’s ability to hear a particular claim, the court must scrutinize the [party]’s allegations more closely when considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) than it would under a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Schmidt v., 1992). C. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss A motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint., Despite this liberal pleading standard, to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Iqbal, 556 U.S., “[W]hen ruling on a defendant’s motion to dismiss [pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)], a judge must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.” Atherton v., Circuit “did not remand the case with directions to allow amending the complaint to include Pool’s individual claims.” Def.’s Objs., ECF No., Pool’s Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss and not any allegations in the FAC., Pool filed with her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss., Although a court may not 16 consider new allegations raised in response to a motion to dismiss, see Briscoe, 61 F., 255 at 9; her objection merely repeats her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare Pl.’s Objs., ECF No., Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 227 at 15-19. Accordingly, the Court reviews this objection only for clear error, see Houlahan, 979 F., See Pl.’s Objs., ECF No. 250-1 at 12-15. As with her repudiation argument, see supra, her objection largely restates her Opposition to CNA’s Motion to Dismiss verbatim, compare id., with Pl.’s Opp’n &amp; Resp., Def. CNA’s Mot.

THE LOWER COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN FAILING TO HOLD THAT PUBLIC POLICY DEMANDS THAT PLAINTIFF BE PROTECTED FROM FURTHER ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY DEFENDANT., As we noted, the trial judge stated she \"did not find [plaintiff's] testimony to be credible or convincing.\" This fleeting reference did not signal the judge had elevated plaintiff's burden of proof because in the following paragraph of the trial judge's decision she concluded plaintiff had not met the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence., The judge relied on more than plaintiff's delay to conclude the filing was motivated by considerations other than domestic violence.]\n",

So, when was Arnold \"injured,\" such that it could successfully sue to establish its rights in the Marmaton formation? We conclude that no injury occurred to Arnold before July 2012, when it first requested payment of its overriding royalty interest., We hold that Arnold brought a timely lawsuit in 2012 to enforce its valid overriding royalty interest in the Marmaton formation under the oil-and-gas leases executed in 1973.]\n",
