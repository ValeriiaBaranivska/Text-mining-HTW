## Case Study Problem
By transforming raw legal text into structured evidence, the project shows how judicial and legislative
signals can be quantified, visualized, and explored to uncover trends, guide policy and practice, and open
new avenues for legal research - work that lies squarely at the intersection of data science and law.

## Case Study Material
In the Legal Text Mining project, you will receive a dataset provided by Open Legal Data. The dataset
consists of a pre-cleaned dump of court decisions enriched with basic metadata (court, chamber, date, ECLI,
citations).

## Case Study Core Tasks
In the summer school project, you will develop an analytic pipeline to discover insights hidden in the large
amount of legal text, for example:
- **Topic & trend analysis:**
tracing how climate-risk litigation or consumer-protection disputes evolve across time and jurisdictions;
- **Citation and precedent networks:**
mapping which judgments or legislative acts act as hubs and how influence propagates through the
legal system;
- **Outcome modelling:**
linking textual or structural features to damages, penalties, or success rates, and examining regional
or court-level disparities;

## Additional question 

- What are the dominant legal topics addressed by the judicial system in different eras? 
- How has the focus of civil litigation changed over time? 
- What textual features (facts, arguments) are most predictive of certain judicial outcomes (e.g., reversal of a decision)?
- analysis of successful cases and what leads to it in order to find main advantages or flaws of different law systems in states (for example) 
- overwriting of the global court rules over the local (maybe some lands tend to be more influenced by the main court)
- how different states/countries treat similar types of cases (e.g. labor disputes, criminal appeals, environmental law) and is it possible to predict an outcome based on state/region vs based only on caseâ€¦
